So for example, we do a lot with composting and AP environmental science. I use the compost bins not only to teach about alternatives to waste disposal, but also to show the students the nutrient density in composted soil versus soil that we dig up outside.","Speaker 1 (04:22): Tell me a little bit about that and how you decided what you needed.

vfudrini@mhrd.org,"Their customer services really great. They also send me all of the forms so that I have, it's already been purchased and I can go in and say, okay, I want them on this date. That all goes through me instead of going through the district level. So I have some control. Alright, I want those red worms on Wednesday. I don't want them on a Friday at two 30. Nobody's going to touch them till Monday morning. Things like that. So I get a lot of that control put into my hands as opposed to leaving it to someone else.","Speaker 1 (09:03): Okay. So you said you had a really good experience with Carolina. What did you like about them?

They have a lot of those really quick labs that I can do in a short amount of time where I don't have to use an entire period or block to do that in, but I can reinforce the material quickly. So I like some of their stuff for that.","Speaker 1 (10:08): With Flynn, can you think of anything that you typically would buy from them?

vfudrini@mhrd.org,"I find that I get, once I've used the kit, a lot of times I'll then piecemeal it together myself. For example, I have a kit that you need test strips for, and they'll mail you the kit and the test strips are almost or already expired, where if I order them separately, I can guarantee some of the quality control versus what comes prepackaged.","Speaker 1 (20:27): In the use of the materials where you wish you had something different because whatever's being provided to you is not what you were expecting or it caused frustration

Speaker 3 (24:05): No.

Speaker 1 (24:10): That says a lot though.

vfudrini@mhrd.org,"I think that one area that would really be helpful is state specific materials that meet state, like I mentioned, our state science tests. There's very little out there that supports the way in which that I can present to my students that supports the way in which they're tested.","Speaker 1 (31:51): Okay, so I'm definitely sending out those gift cards today. So expect it today. If for some reason you don't see it, check to see if it got caught in your spam filter. And if it just doesn't show up, send Kim an email and she's like a blood hail where those things are concerned and she will track it down. Thank you. So we're all good that way.

Speaker 3 (42:04): Did you get my email saying that I don't need Tuesday? Yes.

Speaker 2 (42:09): So thank you very much.

Speaker 3 (42:10): My computer shut down on me and when I went back in the first time was already blacked out, so I just want to make sure that that got cleared

Speaker 2 (42:17): Up. Yes. No, no, that was, yep. Nope, it's all good. And I was thinking, I didn't even know the system would let you do that, so it was like, whoa, okay.

Speaker 3 (42:27): I was like, oh no, I have two appointments and when the invitation came in, I declined one hoping that that would clear it up. But I'm glad you emailed.

Speaker 2 (42:35): Yes. And

Speaker 1 (42:37): Thank you again, Vanessa, for just all that you do for students. We really appreciate it and we appreciate all that extra that you put into it for differentiation and thinking of new ways to teach familiar topics to students. So thank you for all that you do for students. We really appreciate it.

Speaker 3 (42:54): Thank you.

Speaker 1 (42:56): Yeah, thank you.

Speaker 3 (42:57): Bye bye. Good weekend.

Speaker 2 (42:59): You too.

Speaker 1 (43:01): Let's see, Kim, do you want to hang on for just a second? Okay. I'm going to stop our recording.
