But in June when they told me that I was taking over this virtual stuff and now at that point in June, they did not tell me that I had to repeat that process every four and a half weeks. But they told me that part of our state requirement is that they, that they're doing some sort of lab experiment. So then we had to come up with ways that we were doing some of the labs that the kids really like and get a lot out of in the classroom. In the in-person setting, I had to spend a lot of my June and first part of July figuring out how we could take and do those labs or tailor them to how they could do 'em at home.","Daylene Long (16:47):

sdoreyweb@wcboe.org,"I know we did a mitosis lab and I think that that one was with the pop beads. Of course the pop beads, it's just counting out the certain numbers that they need. But as far as some of the other ones, I'm trying to remember, do you remember Who did the mitosis one where you bought that one from? I feel the Mitosis one was actually one that we had here originally to begin with, but I think that we ended up having to order more and don't trying to remember where it came from. I'm digging through an email, emails right quick. I don't remember if that was from Flynn or if that was Wards. I think the pop bead ones we ended up, we did the pop beads with mitosis and then we also did it, we kind of sent the pop beads home for multiple little simulations and labs. So I feel like that it was a Flin box originally, but I could be wrong.","Daylene Long (20:38):

sdoreyweb@wcboe.org,"I know I have done the Macromolecule lab for wards this year. That was a pre-made kit. I have done it is from, hold on, I'm trying to, we did a gel electrophoresis from another company that was a pre-done kit.","Daylene Long (23:02):

So we've got the B lab. Do you remember anything else that you thought, okay, I can use this one as it is and buy it from a vendor?

Sarah Webster (23:02):

For some of them, some of 'em we could find pre-made and that I could make up solutions ahead of time and they store well, maybe they don't need refrigeration and if I mix 'em up now and they'll be good four and a half weeks from now or even in this time if I have sent something home, our new round of kids starts today and they actually, we don't finish with them until January, so that's a six week with Christmas in there. That solutions or things like that would have to still be either shelf stable or stable in the refrigerator or things like that. So then we also, I had the challenge of coming up with, well if we are sending a solution home, what's the best type of storage to keep it in and ordering those things? And so it's definitely been a challenge.

Daylene Long (24:40):

It sounds like it. Of the kits that you were able to purchase outright, do you remember which ones those were? And let's talk a little bit about what worked with those.

Sarah Webster (24:40):

sdoreyweb@wcboe.org,"So I have never been given a specific budget, but we get told, Hey, we have X amount of dollars in the district, get me your orders and then we'll get emails periodically from our supervisor. There is X amount of dollars left in the entire county budget to spend by a certain date.","Daylene Long (34:32):

So looking at the stuff that you buy year over year and the kits and stuff, do they typically give you a budget and they say, Sarah, you've got this much for next year's purchase, how does that work?

Sarah Webster (34:32):

sdoreyweb@wcboe.org,That they can get me the item or that they had the item available to me and they can get it to me in a reasonable amount of time and things like that.,"Daylene Long (36:33):

The other thing that I always kind of wonder from teachers too, is there anything, let's say you have three vendors and they're all the same price. How do you make a choice then of who you're going to go with and is there any extra added value that a vendor can give that's really important to you?

sdoreyweb@wcboe.org,"For the most part, if order something, unless it's a course, the summertime and I'm not in the building, I probably need it within two weeks. There have been times that according to a vendor's website that it's been in stock and I send it and they go to order it and it's telling me that it's out of stock or it's back ordered for three or four weeks, or I end up having to order it or buy it. We'll just say from Walmart for example, and then it comes in because it's not getting to me quick enough.","Daylene Long (37:23):

So they don't tell you in advance that it's back ordered, it's after you place the order, It's

sdoreyweb@wcboe.org,"I mean, for me, I'm pretty loyal to Flynn and that's just my go-to, and I think part of that is that's who, for the most part, the teachers that were here when I first started, those were their go-tos and it was just, oh, we can do one big collective order and save on shipping. And a lot of it's just who they had had, I don't want to say preference, but preference with before I started working here.","Daylene Long (44:20):

So kind of a legacy impairment. Yeah, basically. And is there anything that would make you, if everybody's ordering something from Flynn, is there anything that would make you really advocate for switching?

Sarah Webster (44:38):

I'll voice my opinion and maybe for me, I'm always trying to get the best deal for my money, so we'll just say if wards has something that if we buy it at a bigger quantity, but in the long run when we dish it out into smaller quantities that it's actually going to be cheaper. I sit down and look at the money. But I also, that's just my mentality of trying to make sure that I have enough to go through all year, but also trying to save and conserve and all that kind of stuff.","['Brand Perception', 'Buying Habits']",['Flinn Scientific'],44:20
sdoreyweb@wcboe.org,"For me, I, like I said, pre-lab kits, so some of those already exist, but pre-lab or pre set kits for pretty much all labs so that there's not a whole lot of leg, I don't want to say legwork, but there's not a whole lot of prep work on my backend.","Daylene Long (45:40):

Stepping back now and looking at the big picture and knowing that this is your opportunity really to speak directly to people who can make a difference in what's available for teachers and for students, what would you like to see that doesn't already exist?

Let's switch and talk a little bit about social media. You've mentioned you use YouTube. Are there any other groups or forums or that kind of thing that you are your go-tos for collaborating with other teachers?
