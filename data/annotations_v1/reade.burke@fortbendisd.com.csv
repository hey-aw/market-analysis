reade.burke@fortbendisd.com,"Well, we've had some issues in the past with vendors where we order things and they're not coming in on time or they're not the items that we have ordered. And it's very difficult. We have classroom phones, but they don't ring because we're teaching. They're shut off by the district. It's sometimes difficult with any business for them to understand that while a school is kind of a business, we're not really someone that you can constantly be in contact with. So anytime there's an issue, it's not simple for us to fix. So for us, reliability would be if we're in contact with you and we have a problem, we need it to be fixed the first time. Not in the case.

So part of what came out of the survey was that it's really important to most biology, life science teachers that their vendors are reliable. And I wanted to get a sense from you of what reliability means.

reade.burke@fortbendisd.com,"I would love for them to have conversations with districts to explain the importance of science curriculum. Because sometimes it's difficult for teachers to advocate for budgets because science is not going to be as cheap as social studies. Those are books. History hasn't changed, and those books are going to be a fixed cost, but eventually I'm going to need more fennel failing. And that's going to be something that is consistent. And so sometimes, and this is true with a lot of my friends in teaching across multiple districts, public and private charter schools, they don't understand that you can't just take your budget and divide it across departments. Like all departments are not created equal. And I feel that our society is moving towards STEM. That has been a 15-year-old shift. And so if we want to continue to have research for Covid and push for these things, we need to have children interested in bench based research. And if they don't have exposure to it at 15 and they have an attention span built on TikTok, they're not going to have the attention to solve cancer to find RNA. They're not going to be able to do it. So we really need to have the support here for those long-term changes.","Daylene Long (32:19):
