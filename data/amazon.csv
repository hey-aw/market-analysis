Okay. One last question. And this one is just about you in general. Do you have any particular brand, and it doesn't have to do with your job, it could be a car or a cell phone company. Do you have any particular brands that you love that you just feel kind of on a visceral level? Oh my gosh, I love,

Amanda Fuller (37:18):

I recently got an Audi, so I love that. That's a brand that I love.

Daylene Long (37:26):

What do you love about that brand?

Amanda Fuller (37:29):

Everything's just very well thought out. I guess luxury feeling versus none of the plasticy

Daylene Long (37:42):

Quality.

Amanda Fuller (37:44):

Yeah.

Daylene Long (37:45):

Okay. That sounds good. Kim, back to you. I want to see if we can wrap this up at 1130 so that we can be super respectful of Amanda's time.

Kim Herder (37:55):

What else do you want to tell us? I mean that's jumping to that, but in your position, in your history, what is your ultimate that when you work with whether it was a Carolina Flanner or an Amazon, what's missing?

Amanda Fuller (38:44):

I mean, I honestly don't think anything, sorry,

Amanda Fuller (38:55):

There's a little fly around here. We have open doors open and close all day long. I don't think there's anything, there's not been any time that I've been frustrated that I couldn't find anything or that I needed anything. One, they're one and the same to me. I know they're totally different companies, but one is just as easy to use as the other. And I think my school has made Amazon super convenient is why I would choose them. But I mean, just ease of use. We have an account I can put in my, I type in the first four numbers or first couple numbers of my school and the address comes up. It's just, it's easy.
