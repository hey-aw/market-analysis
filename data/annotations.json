And even if they design it themselves, and I've had some experience, and actually I probably had the more experience with the kids and if I'm getting too tangential, just say redirect is that, for example, I had a really great last year, I had a really great special ed teacher. We did more student-centered science projects with the expectation that whatever that was, they found out if they found out that their thesis, their hypothesis, their whatever it was was wrong, they were okay with it because then the whole point of it was then to go back and to do it again and reform whatever it was you were looking for.

Well, I mean you can go to Flynn and you can get student kit and it comes and you unwrap the plastic and boom, there's sort of this whole thing. They're really wanting students to sort of figure it out for themselves and what kind of materials to do that themselves. However, the thing that has happened, and I've seen this mostly in the last 10 years, is that, alright, I'm going to be the old guy from who graduated high school in the eighties who says we used lab equipment when we did labs, we didn't use the thermometer that you would use to check and see whether your chicken is at 165 to go out into the lawn and do different levels of temperature in that.\n\nRobert.Lehman (12:53):\n\nThere's a lot of that in science now, even in terms of like, oh, let's figure out the different layers of soil by using pudding and gram crackers.

Okay.\n\nDaylene Long (22:11):\n\nSo you mentioned digital simulations and that type of thing.

Well, I think there's still sort of a learning curve, a learning curve for textbooks, but we have used the gizmos, if you're familiar with that. We've used gizmos, we use FETs because they're free. Some of the stuff that we had with no longer having the Adobe player are no longer available to us. I mean you could do simulations for phishing and things like that. Some people have gone through and rewritten the code on them so you can use different or different programs with them. But usually when it comes to those things, if they are, I should say at least the ones that I have found the most sort of interesting and the ones that are most student friendly have been gizmos for that. And it sort of depends upon what the department, for example, when we were totally virtual, it was our department's choice to use the money to do gizmos so that we could do that since we weren't going to be able to do any sort of other kind of laboratory, that was the closest thing to laboratories that we could do.\n\nRobert.Lehman (23:51):\n\nSo\n\nDaylene Long (23:51):\n\nGizmos, are they free?

And let me backtrack just a little bit in terms of whatever the textbook is, is that for the most part, there is usually a curriculum writing committee that goes along with the textbook that gives you a sample curriculum, but sometimes it's not really aligned logically. For example, if you're talking about trees and photosynthesis, it's January in the state of Maryland and if you're a deciduous tree, you have no leaves, there is no photosynthesis going on outside. So in terms of trying to do any sort of experiment in terms oxygen or carbon dioxide or whatever is that, then you go to the simulations. And that's why I said in terms of the gizmos, they have some super ones where you can adjust in terms of the amount of light and the color of light and see how much oxygen is being produced and it'll show you how to graph it and you can do all that kind of stuff, which is good because again, as an aside is that kids need more practice with math all the time, but it's really hard around here for our kids.\n\nRobert.Lehman (27:24):\n\nSo\n\nDaylene Long (27:24):\n\nIt helps give them more practice with math.

It's actually interesting you said that because I had a conversation, a small conversation with David about that today as we're driving to the airport, Steven brought up Yes, last night about David downloading movie or whatever, that kind of stuff. But David had planned what he was going to read while he a hardback book that he was going to read during the takeoff and the landing or whatever. I mean, so he had a backup, but he was still depending on using his device, but if that failed then he had a backup book. And it was just interesting in that. So when you said that too, it reminded me of that, but that was a different, and same at the same time. So maybe it's an expectation of when you'll be using your phone or computer versus when you are doing these other things and when they cross, what the Venn diagram is is when you use both"

It is kind of like twofold. We use, our district pretty much uses the five E lesson model, and so within that five engaged part, you're doing some type of phenomenon. So it could be something that the students can manipulate. It could be something that just really a phenomenon based type thing. And that is what really would be, is helpful to teachers to be able to have some type of something that would fit our standards that's phenomenon so that the students engages them. And then from that engagement, then you can teach your lesson, but at the same time, then later if you're doing a lab activity that's an application or a lab activity connect, then that would be the second type of hands-on type or something that students could manipulate. So it could actually be, I mean honestly and truly don't really like kits because to me it's just like the cookbook, but it has to be something that's more inquiry where the students are being able to be part of it, not like, okay, follow follow these steps. So if the kit or if the material that's within a kit allows for students to be able to expand their learning, then that's good. But if it's just, okay, here, take this, take. That to me is too cookbook ish and I don't like, I personally don't use those.

Some schools take biology in their sophomore year. Some schools may do biology in their freshman year. It just depends. Some schools have a little bit of a leeway, but because some students, they found that they could do better in biology and they were more mature if they took it in 10th grade as opposed to taking it in ninth grade because of the concepts that they would be a little bit immature and not really preparing. So it just depends on the school. Our district has a little bit of leeway as to when you're offered. Usually by the time they get to 12th grade, they've already taken that class.\n\nDaylene Long (23:11):\n\nOkay. That test, you called it an EOC, Is that right? It's the end of the course. Okay."

Most of them are multiple choice, and there may be, it's not something where it's really left for someone to have to really do a lot of extra grading. So I would say it's more of a, if you're looking at DOK, it's definitely not extended thinking because there's not enough time for them to do that. In that little bit of time. It might be some level three, level two, three type questions where they're having to think, use their thinking to process what they know. So it is no longer of course that recall, but they're having to process the information that they know. So sometimes it could include some type of graph, it could include some type of, I guess it would be some type of picture, that's not the right word, but some type of diagram or something. It could be something like that. And then it would be multiple choice questions as well.\n\nDaylene Long (25:09):\n\nBut it helps them to kind of process, have they been learning about data analysis? Have they been learning about process and things like that?\n\nTeresa Massey (25:20):\n\nThese tests require them to make connections, and so if they're just, we find that if the students come to school and if they are able to be able to take those, for instance, biology, it each has standards and in the way it's been broken down, the teachers are pretty much teaching what is in those standards. And let's see, somebody just came in my door, the custodian threw me off. So they're teaching the standards, and through those standards, the standards are pretty clear.

Some of the students still need met me to give them the methods and they can't get that thinking there. But a lot of the questions and the argument part of it was more open-ended and now I actually prefer it more because I think it lends more support to English classes in my school, just like with for every school I've been in because when I was in Milwaukee I taught at North Division and Bradley Tech and they were I think the worst performing school in Wisconsin than the fifth worst performing school in Wisconsin. So reading levels have always been really low and arguments and things like that and being able to explain why on answers has been really low in all subjects.

I went to a conference in my, oh god, when was that? 2015. I went to a conference and I saw somebody using Google Classroom and I'm like, this is awesome. I want to do this.

A lot of it was linking use the computer program, but it was less robust. So I'm just kind of replacing it with that and then kind of changing up some of the questions on the explore learning piece. I see it kind of fitting almost like I used to use FET Labs a lot in the past when I didn't have gizmos because FET lab being free and they're really good. They're just old looking and sometimes don't work very well, but they do the trick too, so I'm going to replace a couple of in-person labs with it, but mostly as a supplement.\n\nDaylene Long (16:36):\n\nOkay.

And that was a lot of me trying to figure out what equipment was just the most cost effective across it. We had to pay shipping on it regardless, it doesn't matter. There wasn't really that many discounts or anything that related to that. Most recently I purchased Nutrient Auger and Petri dish plates for a bacterial growing lab just because that's something I couldn't purchase too far in advance.

I adapted the micro electrolysis thing to kind of fit what I wanted it to do, but if I had to print it and give it to the kids, write out the book and I had no time, it probably would've been pretty effective too. And I know their blood typing labs got a similar kit. I know they have their catalyst lab to show yeast respiration and stuff like that. That's a pretty good one that I've seen before. Usually their microscope slides come with some kind of a kit and some kind of resource involved with it too. Their resources in that end and their kits are usually better.

But a decent lab, something that's written that's going to challenge the kids to make an argument based on this data that they're collecting and not just run a cookie cutter lab, something that's going to align automatically out the gate to the NG, putting it onto the package. Considering a lot of districts have gone to nng SS, that's kind of I think the more popular science one now.

I adapted the micro electrolysis thing to kind of fit what I wanted it to do, but if I had to print it and give it to the kids, write out the book and I had no time, it probably would've been pretty effective too. And I know their blood typing labs got a similar kit. I know they have their catalyst lab to show yeast respiration and stuff like that. That's a pretty good one that I've seen before. Usually their microscope slides come with some kind of a kit and some kind of resource involved with it too. Their resources in that end and their kits are usually better.

But I don't have to soak those little cotton swabs and antibiotic either. They're already there.

But less mixing maybe would be nice in certain labs, especially ones where they might produce some kind of a fume. A lot of the new high schools aren't getting fume hoods. They set up my lab and they gave me bumps and burners and I don't have a fume hood and it's bizarre. I'm not a huge fan of it. I am fighting to get a flame blanket and so I have plenty of fire extinguishers, which is nice, and a safety shower and I wash stations, but just no fume hood. So I think fume hoods are starting to become a really big expense that's not being done as much\n\nDaylene Long (40:07):\n\nThey required by osha."

And I am one of a few in Madison that have 10 years of experience under the belt. A lot of new science teachers if there are any, and there's still science vacancies in this district and in Milwaukee. So the amount of student people that are going to be even wanting to use a fume hood with a class of 40 and things that are going kind of crazy in their room, I don't know if they're going to want to care about that, but I've only ever worked in one school that's had a fume hood in four schools that I've been in, so\n\nDaylene Long (41:03):\n\nOkay.

The only problem is that with only one science teacher, I have to teach just the course. So we can't really do ACTE. We've considered going towards more like a medical pathway with CTE and that would get supplemented by exterior funds. So if I needed dissection pieces or things for a healthcare pathway, that would be a different funding than the science funding. And I know that that's how it's done in other schools with their anatomy program as a part of their healthcare pathway, which is CTE, then therefore that comes out of CTE funds,\n\nDaylene Long (42:03):\n\nBut it doesn't necessarily have to be Project Lead the way. It can be a healthcare pathway.\n\nPatrick McGee (42:09):\n\nThey code 'em as project lead, the Wake horses pretty much for all of 'em. They kind of just, yeah,\n\nDaylene Long (42:15):\n\nBut it's not through Project Lead the Way. They just code it.\n\nPatrick McGee (42:21):\n\nI don't think they're using it correctly. I've been at a school that had legitimate project Lead the Way with a lot of their resources and that was coded differently, but they used it in cooperation with their engineering and electrician pathways that they had. So the Project Lead the Way was their physics course and it was weird how they were connected, but I think it's just a way to be like, Hey, we offer Project Lead the Way courses.\n\nDaylene Long (42:52):\n\nOne other thing I keep thinking of before I bring Kim in, you mentioned that you'd like to see the standard printed on the box that a kit comes in.

The NGSS standards are more complicated than Common Core, and I've studied both and they just are. They're more higher scientific language, they are more complicated. So if you were going to have somebody like a long-term sub or a principal trying to order things for a science teacher coming in without a science background, it is complicated to know what kind of things that you're going to try to get without knowing that. So if you know that you're teaching these six standards, you picked them in a committee or the district has a scope and sequence, but you just have that and see standards, you can kind of pull it off to be like, Hey, this is a thing. Almost kind of knowing what genre of music that you're going to go get if you go into a music store, which doesn't exist anymore, but I'm going to go to the rock section here, smile or the Rock. So I think that would be useful There also, schools are moving more towards standards-based grading as opposed to just kind of like you get your grade based on just the test or your finals at the end and stuff like that. So the district, the school I'm in is now moving towards standards based and it's been a really hard path upwards to that, but to having the standard kind of there just goes like, okay, this lab is for this standard, almost kind of as a reminder and a push towards that better pedagogical stance.\n\nDaylene Long (44:55):\n\nOkay. Do your standards-based grading, do they only test on the disciplinary core ideas in science or did they also test on cross-cutting concepts in science and engineering practices?"

Do your standards-based grading, do they only test on the disciplinary core ideas in science or did they also test on cross-cutting concepts in science and engineering practices?\n\nPatrick McGee (45:09):\n\nIn ours, the way we're doing it this year, and it's kind of different at a competency-based school, well competency I'm putting in air quotes, not truly a competency, but anyway, we have our competencies, which is our standards, and then we have four success criteria, almost kind of like a flexible rubric being like if they can show me that they know the characteristics of life, the parts that make up the cell these things, and I have 'em better written at school, then they get points towards showing proficiency in that standard, which is the competency which we're switching from showing competency in the success criteria to proficiency in the standard buzzword buzzword. So that's kind of what we're doing with it now. And MPS, when I was teaching standards-based grading there, it was showing three pieces of evidence that hit the standard within the disciplinary core ideas that you're teaching for that current unit that you're doing. So we kind of looked more at those. I know the Nng SS has a cells in its function and then there's multiple standards within that kind of umbrella. And that umbrella would be my unit and then all the standards under it that I choose to teach would be the standards that are hitting that unit, and then we'd move on to the next unit kind of thing was how it was developed there.\n\nDaylene Long (46:39):\n\nOkay, that makes sense.

I would record, I used Screencastify at the time to record video lectures and put them online. That was really useful during the pandemic. So they would have that and we would use Explore Learning to do the labs to catch those up. At the time that I started that we originally were forced to use Achieve 3000 for reading and forced is the word I would use for that. And I would assign readings that were the closest to the standards that were also there to teach them the things. But now I've switched to using new ELA and each unit has about three to four article readings in there with questions that I design that are also attached as recovery assignments as well as kind of exploring them into it is. So for example, I did one that was about the states of matter and then an article that was a follow-up that was about a group of scientists that got a molecule down to the coldest that they've ever gotten it and how it interacts at this really cold temperature. What was\n\nDaylene Long (48:33):\n\nThat resource again? What was the name of that that you used with the articles?\n\nPatrick McGee (48:37):\n\nNews? ELA or I guess some people call it Newsela.\n\nDaylene Long (48:41):\n\nOkay, got it.\n\nPatrick McGee (48:43):\n\nI don't know which pronunciation's right, but we have that for the district resource and honestly I have students that read at 200 Lexile and at a 1500 in the same class. So I will print out the articles at five different levels and have students be able to pick based on their lexile, which is why I really gravitate towards new EA because the articles are relevant and and a lot better. And then also at about five really big Lexile levels. So that's another thing that I use to kind of repair missing class time. So readings on new ELA or achieve 3000 digital lectures with questions and explore learning gizmos.\n\nDaylene Long (49:32):\n\nIs there anything else as we wrap this up that you would like us to know?"

Then it would come at the beginning of the next semester before we start in with new things.\n\nDaylene Long (10:44):\n\nSo you do it each semester or you do it once a year?\n\nCody Christensen (10:49):\n\nI typically had two orders a year, so one per semester\n\nDaylene Long (10:54):\n\nAnd then just because everybody's semesters are different, what months are those usually at the end of a semester?\n\nCody Christensen (11:02):\n\nTypically I would be ordering in December and let's see, may so December and May."

Sometimes students suffer from test anxiety and even just seeing what the test is going to look like is a real help for them. What kind of questions are going to be there? A few of the things I used was, one of the things, especially for that state test, is vocab training. Just making sure they know and understand those vocabulary words. And one of the things that really helped was I created some taboo cards, which is a game where you can't say certain words and those vocab words, if you put the three most associated words with that thing on the card and they can't say it, they really actually have to understand the word to get it across. So the example I always use is photosynthesis. You want someone to guess the word photosynthesis, but you can't say green. You can't say sunlight and you can't say tree. And how do you get them to figure out what that vocabulary word is and if they understand those words, a lot of times they can put the word into context of the question and then get the answer right because they know where the word would apply.\n\nDaylene Long (32:27):\n\nThat's a great way of doing that. You're the first person I've talked to that has done that. That's really a great way of drawing out whether or not they know what it means in terms of function and those types of things.

It is something where I would love to be able to see the test beforehand. In the SOLs here in Virginia, we actually just switched from the old standards of learning, which is what SOL stands for to a newer version. It was adopted in 2018, but with covid, we haven't implemented it till, I think this is the first year.\n\nCody Christensen (33:50):\n\nIt's a little tough to say, okay, yes, I have these guidelines, but I have no idea what kind of questions are going to come up. So some kind of bank of what is the test actually going to look like would definitely be helpful. So the one we talked about before, they're all using the old 2015 standards because that's all that's available. I think that would be the best way to prep them that way. But yeah, a few of the things would be maybe some physical manipulatives.

And it was really interesting because they were able to bring in budgeting and mining that we had talked about in class, but they were also able to take in, we put fines on the different messes that they made during the mining process. So if they made too much of a mess, they got a fine, but they noticed that if they mined enough of the mineral that we were looking for, the fine was basically not even there. So a bunch of the kids just ended up dumping the bucket out and paying the little fine because they ended up with all the material,\n\nCody Christensen (38:42):\n\nWhich is something that happens in the real world. Let's see. One of the kits that would have been helpful, I'm trying to think through because I know there was one that I had in my brain just a second ago. Gosh, let's see.

The oysters, we actually have a whole history here of the oyster wars where people were dredging for oysters, which was really ruining the bottom of the bay and the river here, and it led to production just tanking. And so we had to let it kind of come back before they could even start harvesting them again. But again, I don't know exactly how you would do location specific stuff like that in a kit.

My biggest complaint with a lot of the way things get shipped is the overpacking waste, shall we say. We got a box that was the size of, I don't know, the honor bridge, the Oxford dictionary, you know how big that is,\n\nDaylene Long (17:01):\n\nAnd it had"

But as far as the kids themselves, a couple of times you've had kids come where things were broken through, probably rough handling somewhere along the supply chain, but other than that, nothing really wrong with the kit themselves, just the way we get them sometimes, the way they're packaged with other things.\n\nDaylene Long (17:38):\n\nYou just said chemicals that remind.

It kind of levels the playing field more because not everyone has access to full laboratory stuff, but if they can get the basic concepts and understand if A happens and B happens, what could happen with C or in general, this is a thing we've seen predict what will happen in the future if the condition is remain the same. Now from a personal standpoint, I know it hasn't really counted much as far as the graduation requirement yet, and a lot of the students know that, so they don't really take it seriously unfortunately. But those that do take it seriously because they're just driven that way seem to wish it had more content specific stuff, not just the general topic idea, umbrella approach I guess. So it used to be when they had the grade eight proficiency test and the high school proficiency test, those things were more memorization and can you remember this with some application to it.

I love what I do. My students know I love them. I treat them like family, the whole, I've had some administrators who are brand new who I've never met say, oh, you're Mr. Zeki. I've heard so many good things about you from the port of Ed and downtown and these other people like, okay, I don't know you, who are you? But they know me already.\n\n(36:41):\n\nBut I've seen a lot of young people come into the profession their first year teaching. I've mentored a few of them. They really have great ideas and whatnot, but then they get no support, real good concrete support from administrators and it kind of ruins the career for them. There was one teacher who left teaching altogether three years ago. He was actually a student of mine who went on to college, got his degree in chemistry, came back, be a chemistry teacher to show the students in the town that I came from here, here's what I did, you can do it too. He loved what he did, but the administrators just kept adding more and more stuff and pulling him this way and that way. And he just said, they've ruined teaching for me. And now he works for Mark. He doesn't even teach anymore.\n\n(37:30):\n\nIt's a lot of the higher ups who every time we get a new administrator, they think they have the end all be all answer to save the world. And we just look at 'em like, we tried that 10 years ago, it didn't work then It probably won't work now, but we'll try it. And after a year or two it doesn't work, see told you. And I wish they would pay more attention to the people in the classroom. We know what works, we know what is a good thing, we know what we need as far as support from the administrators and too many just don't do that. They just have their own little agenda. They do what they want to do. And if you as a subordinate don't follow along, well then it's your problem, not mine. You're the problem kind of Thing. You're\n\nDaylene Long (38:09):\n\nNot the first one I've heard in this series that we're doing with that, doing so much more with less. And then in that situation.

A lot of the administrators are very bogged down with discipline issues and paperwork and family this and policy that and blah, blah blah. Where some of the kids don't even know who the vice principals are. They never see 'em. They're just hiding in their office. They're handling all these other little things. But then if something goes wrong in the classroom, the administrators are not aware of what's happening in the school. So they don't know what led up to it and what could have maybe prevented or headed off this possible conflict until it gets to the point where now it's a really big deal that shouldn't have been. Some of the best administrators I've had over the years are ones who made sure they walked to the hallways every day. They would stop in a classroom just, hi, how you doing? Can I get you anything? Say hello to the students, greet 'em in the hallways. The administrators who hid in their office and came out only when something bad happened and it was a different feel.\n\nDaylene Long (39:57):\n\nYeah, I have to breathe on that one. Yeah. Okay.

By that I mean there's some labs from other places and kits and materials you look at and go, okay, that looks nice, but it's not practical for my situation or part of this activity I could use with my students.

I don't know how that works, but definitely ask teachers, what activity would you like to do for this topic and what would that look like? And maybe try to go with that as far as designing something new that would be better. Maybe try to differentiate things a little more for the socioeconomic background of places. Because where I teach, it's considering an inner city type of school district. It's got a high poverty rate. A lot of students on the free reduced launch program, reading levels are not where they should be. They're lower. So we get a kit that's meant for a junior biology class, but the students are not reading really well at that level. So I have to take time to break it down for them.

It's not something you do right before the lab for the kids and our schedule, we follow a seven day cycle schedule, and it rotates seven letter days and seven number days, so you don't ever see the students the same time back to back days. So it just requires, from the lab management aspect, I'm learning, it's a lot of planning because you might not see a student, you might see that class maybe only three times a week. Maybe you see the class five days a week, but it's never at the same time because it's a constant routine schedule.\n\nJanet Magargal (35:28):\n\nSo it's good to, you know what I mean, watch the videos, make sure you really know how to prep the lab.

If I know it's a hard concept or a hard lab, watch this video. So you have an idea when I see you on Friday, what your actual lab is. So I haven't done that yet. I've done more of the pre-lab questions, like read this so that when we see each other next and we have a lab notebook, I have the AP bio students go old school, we keep a lab notebook.

And I was so excited to find that box because I'm like, I can introduce chromosomes with them and write with a magic marker, make alleles on them letters. So I was so excited to find them, but it literally took me an hour to organize them because it was all chaotic. So right now, my magic wand is probably not telling you information that you want, but I would love to have my lab organized so I could tell you, okay, yes, I would like this, this, and this.

I'm very, very lab-based, so that would be maybe my magic wand wish that keep things affordable so I can keep buying the hands-on in the lab supplies for my students because they really appreciate. I do a survey with the kids. He always asks, how do you want to learn? What could I do as your teacher to make learning fun and better for you? And I would bet 99.9% of my kids on our back to school survey, they want hands-on want lectures, they want to do things, they want to experience science. And I totally agree with that.

I couldn't find any student directions for, it was a cell membrane kit that I found that I absolutely loved, and it had the proteins embed it and I found it, but then I couldn't find any student interactions for a while. So it is very helpful when there's keys. Some of the kits are molecular model kits, and I might just not have had time to find them yet. They might be somewhere in the lab, but they'll use, okay, red for oxygen, white for hydrogen, and it's very helpful if I have a key. So I haven't found that key. There was an amino acid folding kit that had a key that was amazing. That might've been a 3D molecular design, but it was great and it was even laminated. So I don't know if the vendor laminated that and sent it with the kit or if that was something the previous teacher found. The key of this amino acid is hydrophobic. This amino acid is hydrophilic. These are non-polar polar, and it's a beautiful one page simple color coded and laminated. So keys are definitely helpful for the kits.\n\nDaylene Long (45:02):\n\nAnd those were in the plastic kits that you were getting, so it's sounds like somewhere, okay.

Even at the high school level, you would need things not only translated into a different language, but a huge need for scaffolded material, differentiated, adapted, just different forms of reading levels. So that would definitely be a huge difference. I mean, even in the current school, it would be nice to have options for differentiation. Some students do need things scaffolded a little differently, so that would be a huge time saver. I mean, I would be surprised if you would talk to an educator that doesn't have a diverse group of students, no matter where you are. I mean, they may physically look more similar in some settings than others, but there's always the academic need for structuring things differently, providing maybe a graphic organizer, sentence starters, and anything, I guess along those lines to aid in support.

That was what I think I wrote down, right?\n\nDaylene Long (49:50):\n\nYeah. In general, that's all the research that we focus on. Sometimes it may have a very narrow bent to it. It may be that we're just talking to, we have a client that came to us that is physics in college, and so that's our focus. Or in this case it was life sciences. So in general, catapult X represents clients who are wanting to get teacher feedback, and that's what we really specialize is specifically in Science and STEM. And we only work with clients who provide incentives because we think it's important to make sure that teachers are valued as professionals. We only work with the Science and STEM community, and we really only work with organizations that are looking at it from the perspective of how do we make science education better for teachers? How do we make it better for students?

But it has been wonderful talking to you. And thank you so much for your enthusiasm with the hands-on is contagious.

And they love coming in the room because of course when we did the speed dating organelles, I had to go all out and I put the candles, I brought in mints. So any lab we do, of course I am a little OCD, I take it to that level.

We have new physics teacher, advanced physics electives that are in it.

Maybe in the genetics class they might do a PFA lab, which of course is fun and cool and it all has to do with the flexibility with framing how the students come to the understanding of the content. So because we're really trying to get kids to construct their understanding, it requires very deliberate reveal or sequence of how you teach that. And oftentimes because we have kids creating their own projects, sometimes we want them to try to struggle through the procedure part or sometimes we want them to give them a procedure and say, okay, now change a different variable and do this. So the flexibility to kind of determine where we're going to have the kids do the work and where we're going to do the work is what, I just did this literally yesterday.\n\nRobin (19:07):\n\nI took a Vernier lab and I was like, no, this isn't exactly what I wanted and changed it. And I think that's true and I often think like, okay, so if someone came and said, laid this out, would you use it the way it is? I don't know if I ever would because I'd be, I don't know. I think that's part of being an independent school. I have the ability and the funds and the resources to be able to change those things. I only have the maximum number of kids I have in a class is 18, so I'm not worried about class management stuff. So I think we're pretty unique. I'm not sure we're going to, talking to me is going to be very helpful because we are pretty unique I think across a lot of variables. But if I were to think about what that would mean is having the kit, but being able to have three ways to present it to your kids. You could present it this way, you could present it this way, you can present it this way depending on what your needs are or the levels of the kids, that is differentiation. But it could also be just how you're presenting the materials to the kids too."

From an admissions point of view, our school has seen a big shift and parents are wanting to talk about the whole student. We were at 1.1 of these schools that was like, take the test, do well on tests, be a test taking kind of kid. And we've shifted really far away from that. So the whole student, and since I've been here, the shift has really been about teaching the students that you have and bring out the best in 'em. So that student-centered piece is not about every student has to achieve great test scores. It's about every student has to achieve what they can at that moment in time and celebrating whatever those are and finding opportunities for kids to do that. And so our admissions folks have talked a lot about how they've seen that desire from parents and kids more post covid.\n\nRobin (28:01):\n\nNow, I don't know how long that's going to last, but this whole idea of trying to find balance. So we've actually reduced the amount of homework that we've had. We've actually really, we're still, it's an old school still trying to adopt best practices for grading and best practices for opportunities to retest what that looks like. No timeframe on learning kind of thing even though we know that a semester will end. But so our admission folks have said that from the academic point of view and part of the reason I think I was hired here is we're trying to shift the culture here from one of test and achievement as the pinnacle of learning to lifelong learning, being curious, knowing how to do that, celebrating all the differences, knowing that being smart isn't just great test scores. You can be smart in lots of different ways and providing kids those opportunities to demonstrate that and challenging kids in the right way to make those things happen. We're part boarding school, so we have a lot of kids from different cultures and they come in with very different perspectives of that, which is kind of interesting.\n\nDaylene Long (29:22):\n\nSo parents have shifted to really wanting to focus on the whole child.

So I'd say in those first couple years after Covid, the kids just didn't know how to be in school. And very much so the kids who missed middle school really had behavior and social emotional problems In ninth and 10th grade, they were a hot mess. And kind of just now are figuring out how to be with each other and how to be kind and how to not be so centered and all of the things that you learn I think in middle school in a lot of ways.\n\nDaylene Long (30:55):\n\nWhat is striving?

So\n\nRobin (31:29):\n\nKnowing that homework is going to be deliberate practice and the kids understand that this is the practice is going to help you move forward. So when you assign homework, it's basically no grading on it. It's not like you get this much percent of your grade because you do the homework. Because at a school like ours, I don't know who does the homework. We know it's not equitable for kids who have family situations that are very different. We know that not everyone has to do the homework. If I get it in class, I don't have to do the practice. I can just demonstrate that learning in the next class. And so it's not so much that there's no homework, it's that the focus of the homework has shifted from getting it done to meaningfully contributing to the next class. And so part of that is rooted in kids are stressed and anxious, especially at schools like ours. The data shows that kids at these high performing private schools have tons and tons of mental health issues because they feel this pressure and all these things. So we're prioritizing sleep, exercise, extracurricular activities.\n\nRobin (32:38):\n\nWe feel like those are just as important as the academic stuff or figuring out how to balance that is also important skill.

I'm okay with that. You're\n\nDaylene Long (36:46):\n\nSupposed to be a game player too. My goodness. I'm just flipping through my questions to see, oh, we were going to talk about you've had turnover, but do you feel like that is a post pandemic thing or do you think it's coincidence or how in general have things changed for teachers post pandemic?"

So some folks who had been here for 25 years or went to school here and then worked here for 20 years didn't agree with what was happening and how it was happening. And so they chose to go elsewhere. So that push started with the hiring of me and someone else who was hired at the same time, who's the other chemistry teacher. And then I think that just happened to be at the same time covid happened. And so I think Covid might've accelerated some of that.\n\nRobin (38:18):\n\nSo we actually have working for us now a teacher who quit teaching physics. He taught physics in public schools for 30 years and quit and worked at a nursery nearby, like a plant nursery. And he just happened to be neighbor of our lab technician who lives here, who replaced someone who retired because they'd worked here like 35 years and just was time for them to retire. And he had had enough post covid. He was like, I can't do this. I'm going to do what every teacher I know had done. I'm just going to go work at the nursery and be with plants all day.\n\nDaylene Long (38:59):\n\nAnd\n\nRobin (38:59):\n\nHe's come back and he loves it because he's like, this is amazing. This is dreamy compared to what he's used to. He has a big budget, he has small classes, he's loving it. So I don't know, I think the turnover was already in play when I had hired five years ago and then it just covid accelerated that I would say. Okay."

But if they screw up the lab, they might get an acceleration due to gravity of minus 12 meters per second square and it'll be off and they're like, it's not right. And getting these concrete thinkers in ninth grade to really think like, well is 12 that bad if I look? So somehow striking the balance between doing real science and asking real questions and still knowing that works and that we do get answers that are, I feel like I started teaching 20 some years ago and I always started with a lot of content hammer. We're learning content content and I think all I've done is take content out and just focus on process and skills and things like that. And I don't know where the balance is, but I would love in five or 10 years to feel like I know where that balance between content and skills and real science and kind of, I dunno, padded, I don't want to say padded, not artificial, but you know what I mean. The data we collect in real life is never perfect.\n\nDaylene Long (42:20):\n\nYep, that's true.\n\nRobin (42:21):\n\nAnd so when you have kids do relapse to try to uncover a topic or something, you want them to get good enough data that they see the pattern or what you're trying to reveal the relationship between those two variables. But you also don't want it to be so perfect that it's an algorithm from a computer lab,\n\nDaylene Long (42:38):\n\nWhich\n\nRobin (42:38):\n\nIs some of the problems with online stimulation labs. It's not really because give you the perfect, perfect line or whatever. And we know that isn't what happens.\n\nRobin (42:55):\n\nAnd we know this because we've collected, this is also our problem. The kids think they'd have five trials and they have the answer and it's like, well, not five trials isn't going to do it. So in terms of life science, what I would like to see is real science being done or kids being able to take something that they learn, stimulate it digitally and do it a version of it in real life. If we think about ecology or those things I like here, we really try to use our campus, so the kids are doing ed NA projects of the stuff that there is on campus.\n\nDaylene Long (43:33):\n\nSo Acronym EDNA stands for\n\nRobin (43:36):\n\nEnvironmental DNA.\n\nDaylene Long (43:38):\n\nSo you\n\nRobin (43:38):\n\nJust take a sample from the environment and then you can sequence it and figure out what organisms are there based on the DNA fragments that are in the environment.\n\nDaylene Long (43:49):\n\nThat's super.\n\nRobin (43:49):\n\nSo I would really like to see, and this is what our biology teacher is working towards, the collaboration between real citizen science projects and what we're doing in the lab. So he's really trying, he was working with a variety of institutions. I think there's a dragonfly, there's native dragonflies and non-native dragonflies and he's trying to help some, I can't remember. He's worked with a lot of folks, but real scientists who are in the field collect data and his kids do the work to try and do those things, identify things. So our primary school teacher, science teacher, to the best of her ability tried to get kids to think about contributing to some of the bird studies, native versus non-native birds that are in our forest or in our wetlands or whatever. So the merging of science and science in real life would be amazing. That would be cool. Where kids could really see that I have a long-term vision of the kids on our campus starting in pre-K or whatever, and doing projects on campus that they would see over their course of 18 years here or 13 years here. They could really see like, oh, I pulled the ivy from this little plot and then we planted native species in there from the greenhouse and then I can see that this is now restoring this forest.\n\nDaylene Long (45:22):\n\nThat's neat.\n\nRobin (45:23):\n\nThose kind of projects are hard over the long-term though. You just need so much and a lot of time and resources to do it. So\n\nDaylene Long (45:34):\n\nI want to go back to packaging for a minute. So less plastics, is that in shipping and packaging or is it in the product overall? And does it bug you that the sensors are made out of plastic or the, I mean, what would you most like to see reduced?\n\nRobin (45:55):\n\nWell, packaging is always something I'd like to see reduced, but I think it's, especially in biology labs, it's just the non reusable plastic tips and plastic pipettes and what was I using the other day? The plastic was awful. Oh, I'm in room where the light shut off automatically.\n\nDaylene Long (46:20):\n\nSorry. No problem.\n\nRobin (46:22):\n\nI got to move around. I think that non reusable, non-recyclable sort of plastic waste that comes, the probes are plastic. That's true. I just feel like, especially at our school, there's just a lot of waste and it's the waste. It's just the stuff that isn't, I don't mind it. If I use the Vernier probe for 15 years, it's fine, but if I use this thing once and I'm going to throw it away, it's just like,\n\nDaylene Long (47:02):\n\nOkay. So it's the Waste I get the convenience of it. One melon, your plastic pipette is awesome.\n\nRobin (47:08):\n\nMakes things very nice. Or plastic tips to your micro pipettes. I don't know how to not do that, but looking for ways to, can I reuse that same tip multiple times kind"

One, we have a whole inventory of all the equipment that we have and on that inventory it's attached, like here's the instruction booklet and here is the video of how to use it. And last year in ninth grade, and I think for the previous two years in ninth grade, we actually had like, okay, you three kids are going to become the experts on this probe and you're going to present it to the class and you're going to use the videos and do that and show us how this is going to help us measure whatever dependent variables we can think of or the ways we can use this. So we've done it that way. Kids doing independent projects, we say, okay, go watch the video, come back and then show me that you know how to use it to either our lab technician or one of those classroom teachers so that they can use that.\n\nRobin (49:21):\n\nWe've had students make videos of procedures. If we know a student has done something for a couple of years in a row, let's say with tissue culturing or microbio or platting, some basic procedures, we'll have the kids make it. And our goal is to have a video library of procedures that kids can use. So we are using those resources and they do for sure help kids coming out of code of, one of the things we did is kids just need to learn to follow instructions. So learning how to read and manual and look for the error. What does the manufacturer reported, plus or minus error on this particular tool. Is this going to be the right tool for this job or do it any different tool? So just the logic for teaching kids how to do that takes a week, right? Teaching a kid how to use a tool is a project in and of itself if that tool is going to be used somewhere else. So again, it goes back, what is your goal? Our goal is to get these kids to be doing independent projects and to do an independent project, you have to have some of these skills to build it up. And imagine not many ninth graders get there in ninth grade. They get there eventually, but not all of them.\n\nRobin (50:45):\n\nSo videos do help.

        "snippet":"Barbara Bess-Pashak (06:04):\n\nCollege. I went to a women's college, Douglas College of Rutgers University in New Jersey. Then I transferred to another college that was sort of women oriented, but then it was more convenient for me to, because my major was changing for my master's. So I graduated from Temple University with secondary education specifically in the sciences. From there, I continued on with postgraduate credits, but couldn't decide where I'd like to, what direction I wanted to go into. Everything at that point in my life seemed interesting and I'm taking courses and courses and I just felt like I'm not really headed in one particular direction. So my doctor just sort of got put on hold until I would figure out what I wanted to do. Then my husband and I said, Hey, it's time to start a family. So I'm working for the school district. I worked for an alternative school. It was a 12 month school right before the school district, and the woman whose position I was taking said, I asked why she was leaving. You always want to know why someone's leaving. Am I missing something? And she said, I'm going to go with the school district of Philadelphia. And I said, oh, hmm. She goes, you should apply. Okay. \n\nBarbara Bess-Pashak (07:48):\n\nSo I guess I started the process, and this is an alternative program, a 12 month program for the students who are expelled or kicked out of the school district for behavioral issues. It was one science, one math, one social studies, one English, one of those, and they counseling during the day and they had their breakfast and lunch in the program. \n\nDaylene Long (08:16):\n\nWhat year was it? \n\nBarbara Bess-Pashak (08:18):\n\nWow, so that must have been around 1983. I, yeah, I want to say I graduated in 81, did my master's 82 finished it. I guess I did year round to finish early. So I'd say probably 83 is when I did this alternative program. It was 12 months and then 18 months later I got my position, the school district, which was perfect timing because we received a notice that they didn't know how long their funding would last, \n\nBarbara Bess-Pashak (09:04):\n\nAnd it was a very interesting situation to be in. I'm a young kid at the time and I just assumed I would keep teaching, right. I grew up in a family that valued family education and volunteering. So I just thought, well, I'll just teach. And a woman older than myself who was married to a minister said to me, she realized that I had planned on continuing and she pulled me to the side and privately said, Barbara, if there's no funding, that means you're not getting paid. I said, I realized that. And she goes, and you're not going to work. And I said, my jaw dropped. And I said, I was very honest with her. I said, I'm surprised to hear you say that your minister's wife. I just sort of assumed we give and we give and we give. And she said, yeah, you're right. I am, but you have to draw the line. And"

A year later, I got a phone call again before cell phones. Of course. I got a phone call and I answered it and I said, they offered me a high school position. I said, no, no, I'm very happy where I am. And the department head came to my room and she says, I heard them announce for you to get a phone call. Do you mind if I ask What was that about? Again, remember, I'm a young person, so I think people are sort of looking out for me, or maybe they're just newsy. I don't know. \n\nDaylene Long (11:15):\n\nI thought they were looking out for me \n\nBarbara Bess-Pashak (11:16):\n\nAnd I said, oh, I was offered a position for a high school. And she said, did you take it? I said, no. She goes, why? I said, I'm happy here. She says, no, no, no, no, no. You're young. You need to get into the high school. That's where you belong. I said, but look at you, Rosemary. You are here and you're happy. And she said, Barbara, I've been here. She was probably in her sixties. She said, I've been here a lifetime. I live right around the corner. You need to get out there in the high school, call them back. So I called them back and they accepted my change in decision. Went to the high school and she was absolutely right. Absolutely right. So again, there were people who were helping me and I make an effort to always help the new teachers. I helped the seasoned teachers as well, but definitely the new teachers that they understand what it is that they need to do. They're responsible for don't slip and slide. Some of the other teachers, \n\nDaylene Long (12:23):\n\nWe'll come back to the new teachers because positions like you're supporting new teachers is super important.

At least that's how it was when I first started. The kids would leave my high school in the middle of the day, get on a bus and go to a tech program. But I guess at this point they've all changed. So they offer both. Is \n\nDaylene Long (14:03):\n\nThere a health science or any kind of life science component to it at all, or \n\nBarbara Bess-Pashak (14:07):\n\nNo? No. Okay. That's such a big field. That is true. Even when I came to the school, so I was at a school for like 27 years, 28 years, and it was closing. It was in, I don't know if you're familiar with Philadelphia, but it was in the University City area where University of Pennsylvania is located and Drexel University, \n\nDaylene Long (14:31):\n\nAnd \n\nBarbara Bess-Pashak (14:31):\n\nWe had interns, college interns in our building all the time volunteering. It was a fabulous opportunity. And when the school district was in a major deficit, it was worldwide news, the deficit that they were in, they decided to sell our building because of the prime real estate. And that's how I wound up coming to Edison. So it's very different at Edison from where I was. I don't know why there was something you asked me that was a reason why I brought it up, but when I came to Edison, I know I started a robotics club because I was doing robotics as a STEM piece at my former school, university City high school. And then when I went to Edison, I realized they didn't have one, and I started one. Within about a year, year and a half, we actually got to the state championship. But what I observed was that the respect wasn't really given to robotics. \n\nBarbara Bess-Pashak (15:53):\n\nIn other words, it's the day before our competition for the state, and you're always tweaking your robot, and I asked teachers, could I borrow your students so that we can do the final touches for this competition? Well, the principal found out about it and she said, you can't take a student out of another class, but I did get permission. They'll make up the work. You can't do that. Pss, I would never say this to the principal. We all knew for a fact kids were being pulled out for sports. We knew that students were being pulled out for CTE competitions because some of the different shops have these competitions that their kids will become involved with. So I was a little confused. Why are they permitted to be pulled out for those and this, \n\nDaylene Long (17:02):\n\nThat's interesting. \n\nBarbara Bess-Pashak (17:04):\n\nI didn't say anything about it, but I did bring it up to there was a meeting among robotics team leaders for the school district, and I brought it up there and I just said that I'm disappointed to find that it's not really well respected, even though it's probably the only academic club that the school has to offer.

The science chair was sitting in an interview, so we're able to participate in the interview for incoming teachers. So one of us would sit in for science at the end of the meeting. This was a chemistry position. At the end of the interview, the AP assistant principal, I believe, wanted to send the message to this candidate that they are invested in science, that are, they support science. So he said, we just spent $10,000 on microscopes. And the teacher apparently said, oh, wonderful. And the science chair was shocked. She had no idea about it, no idea. So after the meeting this candidate had left, she said to the a p, is it true that I heard you say $10,000 was spent on microscopes? Yes. She says, we're inundated with microscopes. We don't need microscopes. It's not even part of the curriculum. It's one of those things that you just embed in your lesson. And so some teachers will spend a day on it, some will spend a day and a half, but it's not in curriculum per se, as it used to be 20 years ago. So she said, we really don't need microscopes. I wish someone would've reached out to me. I am the science chair, and we have a wishlist. \n\nBarbara Bess-Pashak (38:52):\n\nThey, there was no comment.

So a lot of my most recent purchases that would be for life science also, it's hard for me to tease that out from the general science equipment that we're doing. Right. So some specific things like that. And then of course we look at things like for the life sciences, some of the kit based programs that are there around genetics, things that we can get that are models, life science models. One teacher was really interested in getting some of the cross section of a flower, those traditional cross section of the cell models.\n\nSpeaker 3 (09:54):\n\nSo I've had, I've had several schools that have started anatomy and physiology programs, and so we've had everything from the one school that was very much a little bit more traditional, and they needed a skeleton and dissection materials because they were doing some survey things to a program that was three years in the making, which is doing virtual with ocular devices. So we had to purchase laptops that had high resolution to be able to do the 3D imaging, and that's in partnership with the Cleveland Clinic. So you can imagine what that programming is, so those kids are actually getting the same experience as the folks that are actually going to medical school."

So within their budgeting, they're able to budget for instructors to instruct the specialized programming and to purchase materials to support that kind of programming. Now sometimes, sometimes that programming is up and beyond what would be the school budget. So for example, to do the virtual Anatomy and physiology lab, it was a district input of over probably $150,000 because we completely redesigned the space to be able to handle not only the laptops, but also the ocular devices for the students. And that is, I think money well invested because it's a three year program, because students go have a first year, second year, third year. So they do some of the more traditional dissection, and then they do the virtual piece where, I mean, they're literally looking at a virtual model of a human being where they're doing.\n\nSpeaker 1 (15:33):\n\nSo it's vr, it's virtual reality where they've got the headsets\n\nSpeaker 3 (15:37):\n\nVirtual, where they have the headsets,"

So basically you have building leadership, your principal and others, that when they are received their buck, and it's based on the number of students that are enrolled in the school. And then there's tiers within services that students need. So a student who is an English language learner has more funding allocated to them. A student who is identified as special needs or gifted has more funding allocated to them. If they're considered twice exceptional, so they are an English language learner and they're special ed or gifted, then there's more funding allocated. So what that allows for is schools to really tailor their content and their instruction to the needs and wants of the community.\n\nSpeaker 3 (13:25):\n\nSo that's really more at the K eight level. At the high school level, we are also school of choice. So you don't go to your neighborhood school? Currently we're doing school choice right now. So families get to choose which schools that they want to attend based on themes that we have present. So we have Cleveland School of the Arts, we have science and Medicine, architecture and Design IT Digital arts, which is more video programming.

We go over that, and then I bring the vendors in, the vendors to go through their dog and pony show, and I have the teachers independently complete the rubric, submit the rubric, and then based on their feedback, I then submit, usually it's three, my top five, I'll narrow down top five, top three, and then it goes on to our chief academic officer and the purchasing to make the final decision.\n\nSpeaker 1 (32:22):\n\nOkay."

If you've got three really good candidates, what are they looking at?\n\nSpeaker 3 (32:34):\n\nHonestly, I mean first and foremost is usually price. So going to look at price, they're going to look at what kind of services being provided. So is shipping included in that price? Is shipping additional, are they only able to ship to a central location or can they ship to the individual schools? Shipping to individual schools puts you up in a different bracket. And then usually when I'm working with those vendors, I work on what kind of training and professional development is included in this bundled pricing that we're getting. And so for example, the last textbook type purchase I negotiated so that we had at least three years of professional development that was available because we get new teachers in, teachers switch subjects.\n\nSpeaker 3 (33:40):\n\nSo I needed to be able to redo the come see McGraw Hill 1 0 1 again to the teacher maybe in that third year saying, now here we are. You've had two years to get used to this product. Now we're going to take a deep dive into how you can really pump up your teaching experience. So to me, that's really important. Again, some of that relationship between the sales reps and the vendors is also very, very important. So like you said, usually I get it down to top three, break it down to top, maybe top two, and then price point. But then it is that customer service experience."

I'm actually wishing that more of them would go back to doing some of the in-person. But one of the vendors that I worked with when we were transitioning to that digital work, I asked if they would be willing to do small cohorts of students, that we could have student ambassadors, and they were willing to come in and work with students rather than just the teachers. So what we were able to do was on a professional development, I was able to pull teachers out of the classroom. The teachers came, they were allowed to select between three and five students to be their student ambassadors. The teachers went and did the teacher training, and we took the students in and we demoed everything from the student lens about how they would submit their homework and how they would do all of that kind of stuff. And what that did is hold the teachers more accountable to actually using the digital materials,\n\nSpeaker 1 (39:32):\n\nBut it also sets those students up as leaders and to be able to be role models.

We had four teachers and during the summertime we looked at this is what I think should be taught first. This is what I think should be taught first, and we would hash that out together. But every other year I've had that liberty to do what I want to do and it does vary. Most of the time I pretty much follow the state curriculum guide and I do their strand one, strand two, strand three. \n\nSuzanne Matrisciano (07:15):\n\nA couple of years ago I was supposed to start with biotic and abiotic and the student who was supposed to be in my seventh period class committed suicide the day before school started, and so I flipped it.

Generally speaking, I do start with that concept of what is science? How do we use science in the real world? Why do we have to take biology? And we go into the characteristics of life, we work our way into the chemistry, then we do cells. We go through those organelles very generally, and then we start going through the processes that are happening in each of those cells. And for me, I think it makes more sense the way we do it and then I end up at the end of the year right before the test with those subjects that I think the kids have the best background on, which is the ecology type stuff. Because if we don't get to something, I want it to be something that the kids can figure out on their own."

I've got A lot of what we do nowadays because of time constraints, it is more paper labs than actual labs and the actual labs that I would've done 25 years ago, I save for the month after testing when I've still got to have 'em in class and I've still got to do something that looks like education and at that point, a lot of the labs are things that I pull together.

I know we have a science teacher who is only part-time, so she does not get a card, but almost all full-time teachers get a card. Now as a science teacher, there are also some other funds that we can tap into. I'm not technically in charge of those funds. I submit a wishlist to the principal in the final days of school after the kids have gone home and we get what we can with however much money we have left and my wishlist is put together with the other two teachers and somebody else is making the decisions on what actually gets purchased at that. \n\nDaylene Long (12:33):\n\nWhat are some of the things you put on a wishlist? \n\nSuzanne Matrisciano (12:39):\n\nWe put some chemicals, we put some equipment.

She has zoology class and a and P class, so she puts that type stuff on there. We add things like gloves that we know we're going to use, but without knowing exactly how many kids we're going to have, we don't necessarily want to spend our EEF money on it."

You had the ecology where you set up different characteristics about the bunny rabbits and you could select the number of wolves and you would turn 'em loose and they would eat a set percentage and then the bunnies would reproduce and you would do several generations like that and that's gone now in terms of being able to just log onto a website and find it. I keep hearing, oh, you ought to try this company and the state of Mississippi, they purchased access to Gale, GALE, and I was originally told, oh, it's going to have all these online labs. You're going to love it. But at least in terms of what I see, it's kind of more like an online textbook. It does have interactive images where we can go into a cell and we can pull off the cell membrane and see the organelles and we can open up the chloroplast and see the TH cord, but that's not a lab. It's my understanding that it is more lab for certain subjects like a MP or chemistry, but not being those teachers. I don't see that material, so I don't know it for a fact. \n\nDaylene Long (28:50):\n\nWhat about hands-on labs?"

I'm not sure the number. We put the food product on a brown bag for the lipid test. We do those for sure. We've got various enzyme tests reactions. We do the one where you grow the yeast and you have the balloon on top of it to measure how much carbon dioxide's given off where you kill it with the heating it up and you kill it with pH. And then how does temperature affect it? How does pH affect it? We do some in photosynthesis and cell respiration. Of course, we don't do the mouse part of the cell respiration, but we have cell respiration. Ones that involve yeast and which looks very similar to the enzyme one, but we go at it from a slightly different aspect. But once we get to genetics, not so much that pretty much has to be paper labs because we just small school, $700 that I know I can spend every year.

Last year for the first time in forever, I had two classes that were just ninth graders, which is kind of in English. Those would be the honors kids. \n\nDaylene Long (33:25):\n\nThey're the classes where you're going to have all A's, \n\nSuzanne Matrisciano (33:30):\n\nBut most of the time I've got a mixture of those ninth graders and those 10th graders. I do usually have one class that is pretty much all 10th graders because 10th grade is when our kids can start doing vo-tech classes. Those all 10th grade classes a lot of times do end up being the IEP class where I do have a co-teacher come in and that co-teacher does help with keeping his own kids on track. He will answer questions for the regular ed students, but it's not his job to make sure they're doing what they're supposed to. We do try really hard to, when we form groups, regardless of whether it's worksheet type, whether it's lab type, we try to put a low, a medium and a high together. Occasionally I will do groups of high and groups of lows where they are separate for review purposes \n\nSuzanne Matrisciano (34:43):\n\nAnd I don't know about other schools, but they want me to be done teaching by spring break so that we can spend whatever time we have in fourth nine weeks reviewing material for the state test. So during the spring reviews, I don't have as much scaffolding as I do during first, second, and third nine weeks when we are covering that new material in order to sometimes make it more challenging for those upper students who are trying to work with the lowers and I know that I know they're going to just give answers if I let 'em. I tell 'em things like you can only say yes or no. The other two students have to be the ones proposing and coming up with and your aspect is to guide them by saying yes or no. During those scaffolding, we are grouping by ability. I do often try to find activities on teacher pay teacher where it is already scaffolded for me where the lowest students are getting multiple choice where it may only be two choices. The middles are getting the ones that have the word bank and then the uppers are being given questions where they have to write it out for themselves. They constructed response. \n\nDaylene Long (36:20):\n\nThat makes absolute sense. Okay, one more question before I ask your opinion, be your big opinion on that. It's kind of a trend we've seen in these interviews of talking about distractions in the classroom and the use of phones."

When they had their own computer, they technically could pull it out whenever they wanted to check something, to look something up, to type notes directly into the computer and that was a huge problem. Of course, they would have YouTube running in the background and they'd be listening to it on that earbud. They would be watching YouTube out in the open. So we got a program called Class-wise where I can see what's on their monitor at any time and I could close it, I could lock it down so they couldn't go back to that site, that sort of thing. \n\nSuzanne Matrisciano (37:49):\n\nNow that the computers are in a cart in my room, I can lock it and they can't get on it until I tell them, go get your computer. And so that has reduced a lot of that for me. We do charge 'em $25 if they get caught with their cell phones, so we have a lot more trouble with the distraction in August, but by Christmas pretty much those kids are not going to touch that cell phone because mama's not going to pay for it. And if you don't pay for it, then we keep it for 30 days the first time and 60 days the second, and then we keep it for the rest of the year or the third time"

But yes, we are because I do still put things in the Google classroom and today, today they were threatening tornadoes for us and so half my kids were at home. So I switched gears and gave 'em a video quiz and I sent 'em a message saying, Hey, if you weren't here today, you've got to get this done before I see you again. And most of the kids are going to use iPads or cell phones to get that done because they don't have computers at home.

So it's really your opportunity to speak directly to \n\nDaylene Long (05:51):\n\nScience and STEM development companies, and that's pretty much what Catapult X focuses on. And this is a client that wants to specifically know about life sciences and biology. So let's see. We're going to ask a lot of what and why questions, and we're going to kind of go with the flow for whatever's working or not in your area. No right or wrong answers. It helps some people to think of Kim and I as filming a documentary because we'll step back and say, okay, who was involved with that? Did you have a committee with that? Or those kinds of things. So we get a full picture of what's going on. So those are the basics. Any questions on that? \n\nTanya Clark (06:43):\n\nNo, no, that's great. That's great. Actually, I like this. You're not trying to, I'm short down the line. People are going to want to sell products, but I really feel like it's a benefit to get insight. Some companies are just really out of touch with the goings on of the 21st century post pandemic school system, or they're trying to be, and they're still not understanding all of the unique nuances also that are affecting everything that we're doing. So I like this. \n\nDaylene Long (07:19):\n\nWe ran into that same, and I'd love to have you just dive in to talk more about that because we ran into that same theme when we talked to a superintendent from New Pennsylvania.

It was something that was, if you do well, it'll speak to you doing well in life. It was a priority. Going to school was a priority. Being an educator was significant. It was you were here for the, I've always wanted to be it and I am it. And even if I came in later, I came in for a reason. So just starting there, it shifts things in terms of thinking of programs and all kinds of things, knowing that once that is distributed, it may not have the same spirit in which you send it out. You know what I mean? Not the thing you value may not be of value in the way that you're sending it or you are purporting it to the school community and then you may not even know what that may be. \n\nTanya Clark (08:48):\n\nThe whole paradigm has just shifted. It's a huge, like I said, school. So we have attendance issues and I mean there's some negatives. There are some positives though. There are some positives, but it's like, and there's so much, there's so out there as well. Everybody has a program, everybody has a way, everybody has a theory, everybody has a, this everybody now, there's all kind of laws and it is just, we're not focused, I don't think, and I don't know if we'll ever will be. Our path is everywhere if I can just say we're all over the place. And then with staff changes, it gets set more deep because you don't have people staying in that long as much as it's a lifetime of a commitment. You set up a program, you set up a pathway and people have moved on or there's been staff shifts or program shifts, and you don't have that level of what was a traditional type of stability. You've got to find it. You've got to create it. So I'm \n\nDaylene Long (09:55):\n\nHearing that it's affecting this kind of post pandemic teaching world has affected students, parents and educators across the board is what I'm hearing from you. \n\nTanya Clark (10:05):\n\nAnd it was happening before.

But it's challenging and that's everywhere, every day, every single day. And schools have not formally, they're not designed for these new changes of parenting, these new changes of kids, the new staff, the new type of administrators. We're still in our centered block buildings and weird. It is a struggle. And I work in a fabulous place. I work in the app. This is one of the best school districts ever. But we're open about our challenges and \n\nDaylene Long (11:07):\n\nOur \n\nTanya Clark (11:08):\n\nSuccesses. \n\nDaylene Long (11:09):\n\nWell, so let's talk a little bit more about that. What kind of things, and let's go through those different levels. What kind of things are you seeing that has changed post pandemic with parents? So the parents and students, so that support that they're getting at home. \n\nTanya Clark (11:27):\n\nWhen I came up as an educator was to say, I'm going to call your mom or get a parent, connect with them. It wasn't as difficult, but you've got complex parenting situations. You've got, for example, I'm going to give you a perfect example, homework. I mean, my teachers got to the point, they're like, we're not assigning, it's just not getting done. But they were thinking more traditional. You really thought you were going to say, I want you to do this and bring it back tomorrow. And back in the day you would have that and you wouldn't. That's an expectation of coming to school. I got emails of parents who are offended by homework. How dare you invade our personal lives with homework and actually having kids to even bring anything from school into home. Our textbooks are not distributed individually to our kids. We have class sets because that's not something that's of value to a lot of some of our parents. \n\nTanya Clark (12:30):\n\nAnd we have a economic structure. Our demographics are arranged. So it's not a poverty stricken situation. It is a mentality. It's a mentality. After Covid, people want to live their lives. You see more concerts, you see more events. Everything has to be an event. I don't want to be in this house anymore. I don't want to be confined by any space including school anymore. And then also, I really don't, I want to have kids, but I really don't want a parent. I know I had these kids and I had to take some responsibility for their future, but you know what? They don't have to leave. They can stay here till they're 30 and 40 and 50. They can bring their children and their grandchildren. I've even got staff that say that, oh my child, a baby will redoing the house so that family can be in that. \n\nTanya Clark (13:27):\n\nNo, the messages are, so the expectation number one of post-secondary life affects everything of that. What I expect you to be independent and everything like that. And the parent's like, no, I don't expect that they can stay here. So then what are you, okay? It was a whole college based, okay, you're going to college. Well, that's not the case. Graduation, I look at the every year there's a decline in the amount of kids going to college. They may be going to, some of 'em may be going to two years, but not even that. And they've done so much to try to build that. So it's like I'm telling you something to prepare you for a future goal that is not really the case. And our staff may be out of touch with what is the end game here? What are we preparing you for? So then it starts to weaken. Then I don't have to know this. \n\nTanya Clark (14:24):\n\nThis is just a moment in time. It's not something that needs to be an enduring, I don't need to be that learner when it comes to parents, it's very cavalier. It is. I mean, we are dealing with parents that are, I don't even want to say young parents that are just not equipped or not doing what they need to do to work with us. And I actually had a conversation with, we had a meeting with the state and I told them that. I said, I need the safe to do a better job. You're throwing money at us. You're throwing money. We can't make any moves without the parents. When the parent says no, and they don't have to, and they don't have to come to school and they can just lay there with them and they don't have to pass the class. That attitude is there and it's all of our faults."

So you're throwing money, but you're not hitting what we need to have hit. We actually wrote a grant and I said, I was talking to my superintendent, we need, we're missing a parent piece that's going to speak to this 21st century parent. Whether the parent is fresh out of prison, whether the parent is a millionaire, because we've got millionaires walking around. They've done becoming a millionaire from YouTube, social media, whether they're 80, can't see in one eye, but I'm raising my grandchildren or my great-grandchildren. So who speaks to them? We've got all of these scenarios \n\nDaylene Long (15:54):\n\nAnd what does that look like? So what does it look like that you are communicating or involving the parents and is it even possible? \n\nTanya Clark (16:07):\n\nWell, I think it is, but I think we're going to have to take more of a direct approach. The answer I got from the state was, well, we have resources online. And I'm like, you missed it. You missed it. That's not our day-to-day. You missed it. We are having a whole communication breakdown, a whole generational breakdown, a whole different parent. We've got expectations and they've got expectations. I need a liaison to be in the gap. And that's what we were putting in there. We were like, we want a specialist. I'm recommending that actually for every school. And I will just speak for our state that there's before you, just to answer some of your questions, just to help you navigate some of the nuances before. Because what we're getting now is contention, anger. We're getting, I mean you knew, I don't know if you know this, when they changed the laws about what we're teaching kids about sexuality and how that's all coming to boards and everything, but that anger started because of the communication piece. \n\nTanya Clark (17:07):\n\nWhen parents trust the school district and they have a good communication, you didn't see it become that volatile. I mean, it was legit volatile. They were threatening teachers, staff, you're not teaching my kids that, whatever, because I don't trust you. I don't know you because you don't know me. And so that's where we're getting more and more of that and that empowered people. They call us, cuss us out. Student gets in trouble. You know what, I'm going to just text my mom. You know what? I'm coming up there to get you. I'm just coming up there to get you. I don't even want to deal with it. The significant amount of people that, because they're dealing with discipline issues that are now pulling their kids out to homeschool 'em and aren't really doing it, but I'm sick of the school calling me. Well, maybe there was somebody in the gap there that can talk to you for real, not show you data, not just offer an IEP. \n\nTanya Clark (17:51):\n\nWhat is going on? I told my teachers, I said, now when you do parent conferences, it used to be you have to show you care about the kids, but now you got to show you care about the parent. How are you Ms. Long? How are you making? Well, I had surgery. You can't skip that and say, Johnny's failing because she's going to shut down. Everybody's in their affective domain and their emotions and their feelings, and I'm like, you've got to be that person. If you're going to survive talking to parents now because they're going to want to know you care about them, then their child now, we'll see about getting that work. Because now it's just so easy to be text and email and remind, and people don't want to really have those conversations. So we're recommending that that happens. And I'm also recommending that there's somebody that stands who is that liaison person, not to chew an officer, but there's a communication. If your child keeps getting suspended, why does this keep happening? I don't need you to go to the counselor. I need to talk about what is going on. And then we'll see somebody. You know what I'm saying? I know I can talk a lot, but I have this whole thing."

I just think we are really amplified dealing with kids just having functional basic skills. We're tackling literacy right now where I'm like, we're not going anywhere past that. We have more than 50% of our kids who are not reading on grade level all the way up into high school. We're testing our seniors to see what their lexis are prior to graduating, I told my staff, I said, we're going back to the 1950s. We're missing something here. Kids are graduating. They're trying to go to college and they're failing out the first semester, or they just can't mentally handle it. The other thing we're dealing with are a lot of emotional, mental, behavioral issues. They are astronomical. We are not, I mean, and that's where some of it is not because the child has something clinically wrong with them. \n\nTanya Clark (21:20):\n\nIt is just the parenting has allowed them at preschool, students running all around. There's nothing wrong with that student. Just they were allowed to do that. So we're like, you know what? We're going to sneak in some. We're talking about it. We're going to break the law. We're going to sneak in some parenting classes because our preschool program's free, but I need you to understand how your behavior affects this child's behavior, and we need to get you to think that way.

The things you do need to deal with developmentally, because you still got to go through those stages of those social and emotional behaviors. But just, I don't want to now. I just want to be by myself. And so just working to socially be interaction with them socially and not them. And they're very self-centric because they're getting spoiled to death. Some of them or some of them are just reaching out because it was funny because one of the counselors or somebody was telling me that the kids, they like being around this person so much. So they wanted to call the person mom. And it happens a lot. You know what, I'm calling you mom. What makes you have a mom? What made you want to do that? Because you're giving me something and I want to show you I value and attach myself to that because now I'm going to call you mom and I'm going to feel that when I see you in the building. Yeah. Stuff like that. And it happens a lot. Some many people got kids call the mom just \n\nDaylene Long (25:19):\n\nMy goodness. So on the teacher level, one of the things that we've heard is that what it means is they need a lot more flexibility in the curriculum that they're teaching to be able to differentiate. Is that your thought too, or do you have a different thought on what teachers need because of this shift?"

So I work with them with other companies, but I will say they're not calling me about science. They're not making that specific where they have a person. So a big company, having a person that's like their key science person. I see you're ordering a lot of science materials. I see your state has changed your standards in science. What can we do? What can I show you? I got to reach out to them. Okay. Can you give me a crosswalk for the standards? Not specific. Unless I pay for pd. And then that's just one and done. So if they want that to really come alive, just like having that key, once it triggers your ordering science materials. If it's a big company, then there's a person who again, becomes a part of our staff and helping us develop, helping us when the standards change, helping stay on top, just being with us in the journey. That would be great. And when I work with companies like that, we stay with them. We grow. We get a relationship with them and we trust them. Now you're not just calling me, hi, I am. I just want to talk to you about this company. I'm deleting that. I'm sorry, I am busy. But now I get a call from Daylene. I'm like, oh, hey, well, I just want, Hey, time, just checking in.

And I fail to recognize even as a teacher sometimes that when I'm teaching these kids, they unfortunately aren't going to do anything with when they leave here. And besides maybe just, oh, I remember learning that as opposed to, Hey, is there a skill they can take with us if they don't go to college, they don't go to school. Hey, you need to learn how to interpret data. You need to know how to be curious about why something.

But they might surprise you in how they end up using those things because even when you vote, you need to be able to understand claim evidence and reasoning to make a decision as to whether or not that data is valid. So it becomes just, or when you go to the doctor and they make a recommendation and you have to decide whether or not you get a second one. So I only bring that up because you said you weren't sure if they're ever going to use it, but I think that\n\nErin\/Sean (35:04):\n\nWell, they're going to, they don't know. They don't understand.

But in the kids' feedback, I daily kind of feel like I fail at my job honestly. Because you see a group, it's almost like just stoic. And I don't really realize that they're learning until the work they turn in, obviously, but they give a little survey at the end of the block and they're like, oh, I learned a lot.

It's just up the street from us. We can just, how cheap can they possibly just deliver it to us? And it seemed okay. The price wise was $88 for the sea urchins. I was like, great, that's perfectly fine. But then shipping was another 300 bucks. They wanted to tack on that, and I was going, how come it's so expensive? I mean, literally you are at best two hours away by car. I mean, literally I could just drive over and pick it up and come back and they're like, well, we don't do things that way. We have to send them overnight with FedEx or with UPS and stuff like that. And they charge us 300 bucks and we're just passing all the cost to you. So I went back to Carolina.

I just got the sheep organs behind me. So I was flipping through here and I said, do you need, how many do you need? He was like, well, I need 12 rocks and I have to have this and I need to have a nail so that I could scrape through. And I was like, okay, fine. So I started flipping through this catalog and it has a really neatly broken down by colors, different sections and stuff like that. So I sticky noted and gave it to him and said, here, check it out. You can actually get for the same price that we're getting three, we can actually get 10 for your class if you need that many so you don't have to kind of cut corners and you can have more of a more diverse setup for your lab. He came back to me this afternoon, he says, actually, this will work really great. It'll be cheaper and we can get six. So he goes, I want six instead of three with the other group. So I was like, okay. Okay.\n\nDaylene Long (22:06):\n\nAnd you mentioned the sheep organs. Did you get the sheep organs from Nassco and that's where the catalog came in or, yes. Okay. All right.

Normally it's like we can't get it from the initial vendor, so we end up having to punt and go ahead and get it from Amazon instead because it's just, we can get prime shipping. So we get it overnighted to us and it resolves. One of the issues I came up with was that they didn't have chloroform for one of the chemistry labs they were doing and they needed some pheno and they weren't able to get it from the normal vendor of Flynn, so they ended up having to get it from Amazon. Amazon was able to give it to us the next day. So it just worked out everything else we would get from them. Huh,\n\nDaylene Long (29:49):\n\nOkay. Do you have a preference for the companies that specialize in life sciences or is it really, I'm just trying to get a sense there. You said that you go to Carolina for everything, living and nassco for everything that's not living. How did you make that distinction?

So I explained to 'em, it's like you might think that chemistry is a foregone object in your life. I know how much you were looking forward to it, but guess what chemistry is going to be with you in this class as well too. And I showed them some basic reactions and stuff where hydrogen gas was released from the combination of product and chemicals and we set that on fire. So it was beautiful. Nice blue, magenta flame. They loved it. They're like, this is great. The room smells, but it smells great. It's great.\n\nDaylene Long (50:21):\n\nThat's great.

So we had about a hundred kids at our elementary school for about an hour and a half until we could get 'em back on the bus and then once the road was opened up. So that doesn't happen very often for us, but we dealt with it and that's kind of one of those welcome to the superintendency"

It's just a test that they have the kids take. Science has not been necessarily a standalone subject for us at an elementary level.

We had a STEM lab that we purchased.\n\nGary Buchsen, Port Allegany SD in PA (14:48):\n\nAnd then what we've done as well is there's a curriculum piece. It's about $10,000 a year, so the various activities and whatnot that the kids will do. But what we were able to do is we used some of our ER's money and we front loaded, if you will, I think we did a five year curriculum purchase so we got a better price, what have you. But in terms of dollar figures, both of those labs were between a hundred and $150,000. Great group to work with you literally you provide them the space, they do the design and they come in and they install all of your desks, your labs, your functioning robotics kits, all of your interactive activities. They do that in a weeks' period of time in the summer and then they do the teacher training on the backside.

And when we were able to see what they did at Bradford, we visited there and we felt that this was a great investment with our kids.

But to give you some idea, in the state of Pennsylvania, again, I don't know where you guys are at and I guess it doesn't matter, but the point is this is now three years running in our commonwealth that when you take the 500 public school districts, there have been more teachers hired on an emergency certificate than are actually certificated to teach. That's astounding. These are people that they might have a business degree, but as long as you have a bachelor's in Pennsylvania, you can be placed on a one year emergency certificate. But again, in the last three years there have been more teachers hired collectively on emergency certificates than actually have certificates to teach"

I think the more things that vendors can do to make them hands-on and user-friendly is going to be incredibly valuable because you're not going to be able to rely on the expertise of this person because number one, they haven't necessarily been trained per se, they just have a college degree and the more things that textbook companies or vendors or what have you, the more things that they can do to assist in the course and materials and supplementals, everything that will be probably more important than it ever has been simply because the staffing issue\n\nDaylene Long (26:44):\n\nThat makes a lot of sense.

What we did last year is we worked with, there's another group of schools in Pennsylvania, they're called the cyber charters. So these are the stay at home all distance learning capacity. So what we did, we did a one year collaboration with Commonwealth Connections Academy where we paid literally for them to pipe their classes into our district. We had our biology teacher oversee the class on our side and that got us through the end of the school year and now this year she's more comfortable with the subject matter and she's able to actually go ahead and teach it. I guess back to the lab part of it, and if we were to do any type of collaborative with neighboring school districts or what have you, I think it would be significantly easier for all of the member schools if you had almost like prepackaged lab experiments instead of trying to piecemeal and find all the supplies and everything that you need.\n\nGary Buchsen, Port Allegany SD in PA (28:34):\n\nI think if a school district or a group of schools were to buy that as a group, that makes it a heck of a lot easier.

But I think a vendor partnership or collaboration, whether it's maybe something like this, access to what would be considered a master teacher or somebody who is maybe taught in a distance capacity or something like that, the more things that vendors can do to assist in that bridge, if you will, to get that uncertified person to the point where they're competent within the classroom, they're comfortable in the classroom. I think there's great value in that as well. Probably even more so than a regular curriculum setting because a lot of times if you have a teacher that's 20, 25 years in the business and you have a new math curriculum or whatever at the high school, this just in, they're probably going to figure it out. They probably don't need a lot of the PD that maybe is offered, but if you've got somebody who's been working in marketing for 10 years but likes working with kids, the PD is a greater value for somebody like that.\n\nDaylene Long (31:42):\n\nYeah, that makes sense.

There's a handful of vendors, but I really, really enjoy talking to superintendents from Iowa, Montana, Colorado, Alaska, California, and some of them are large, some of them are small.

Some of the states have programs to move paraprofessionals into a professional capacity and things like that. So I think some of the states are maybe a little further ahead, but Pennsylvania's dabbling in some things right now to make it easier in terms of accepting certificates from other states. There's a grant program that will pay for paraprofessionals to earn their associate's degree with the intent that eventually they'll be able to work into a learning, get their special education, so the needle is moving in our commonwealth.

We lose between a percent and 2% of our student population. We say, well, that's not that much. Well, 2% of 10,000 is 200 kids, and Austin's a small school district in the state of 107, or excuse me, 170. So every single year we are losing our smallest school district in our region. So again, you're going to get to the point, well, do I need a French teacher when I've only got six kids that have signed up to take French and you want to be able to offer that to the kids, so how are you going to do it? Or you're going to share staff amongst those smaller schools. So whatever the providers can do, assuming that maybe that staff member doesn't have a wealth of experience as a veteran teacher would, whatever they can do to assist again is great value. And again, I don't think the schools would be concerned about price because it's something that you would want, something that you would need.\n\nDaylene Long (41:06):\n\nGary, where are those students going?\n\nGary Buchsen, Port Allegany SD in PA (41:10):\n\nThey just move out of our area. When I say we're a small rural area, this trend has gone on for about 30 or 40 years. RIU we do, it's called the third day attendance. So everybody puts their numbers in there, but we have our trends from 40 years ago, 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago. But the nearest Walmart is 45 minutes away from where we live. People want to be moving down south, whether it's Florida, Texas, Carolinas, what have you. But this is not uncommon in all of the rural parts of Pennsylvania have they call it the Pennsylvania T. So when you look at our state, you've got Philadelphia in the one corner, you've got Pittsburgh and the other corner, then there's that T.

In our school district, our administrative team is myself, a high school principal, an elementary. I have a principal that does all the special education work in the district K to 12, and a business manager. That's it. We don't have curriculum directors, we don't have assistant superintendents for elementary curriculum or secondary. We just don't. They don't exist. And I'm worried about house fires and getting buses through and doing federal programs and stuff like that. And that's why I said this collaboration piece with the small schools, there's only, there's two school districts of our 14 that has an assistant superintendent that's Bradford and St. Mary's, nobody else does. So a lot of the curriculum work or whatever is just kind of like a shared type thing. And probably best practice would be to sit down and read all of the research and allow that to drive your processes. We don't have people to do that. And like I said, I'll be done with this call and I'll be working another two, three hours tonight and I'll go back in and do it all tomorrow, but I don't have a lot of time that I can dedicate on that end of it. Now your big schools do when you have full-time, department chairs and things like that, those don't exist here and just they won't exist\n\nDaylene Long (48:47):\n\nBecause, Well, that sounds good.

And I'm not anti-technology, just lots of teachers, but until we and the science people and the companies kind of develop a way to either integrate the phone into how we are teaching it, then you're going to see more and more schools. One of the biggest districts here in Nebraska at the high school level, well pretty much K 12 has just banned cell phones from the classroom. Our school board is probably moving towards that as well, where just the cell phones are just, they're either stuck up on the teacher's door or they're just not in the classroom at all, which I don't know, is that really the right answer? I mean, kids, the phones are just really great tools for figuring things out and finding information and collaborating and all of that.

And one of the things is, I mentioned earlier, our seventh and eighth grade is not even teaching any life science since four years ago. So now our students have a really big gap because they haven't had any life science since sixth grade, so they're going from sixth grade to 10th grade and no life science. So there's no wrapping around on those big ideas even. \n\nJoe Myers (36:49):\n\nYeah."

Specifically in this unit, we talk about how water pollution can impact the ability of kelp to photosynthesize. We talked about how increased carbon dioxide can help kelp photosynthesize, but also causes acidification. But instead of when I was in high school, we spent a week talking about photosynthesis, and then we spent the next week talking about cellular respiration and we memorized some formulas and we moved on with our lives and it didn't mean anything.

So the reason behind this is they shut the power off constantly in the evening and on the weekends here. So I would have to take the animals back and forth in addition to the fact that our school isn't so fond of people bringing animals anymore. We actually had a situation quite a few years ago where we had a teacher bring an animal into school that was not very controlled, brought a dog in school that I think maybe became aggressive with a couple of the students and they kind of frowned upon that right now. But I used to have a lot, I used to have fish and amphibians. I used to have a pet snake there in the classroom and all those things, but I'm, I'm not in my own classroom right now, unfortunately. I'm sure you can see there's French behind me, not biology, but I unfortunately don't have them in my classroom anymore. I used to have a lot, but\n\nDaylene Long (10:41):\n\nThat's too bad. Is that sad to hear stories, but I totally understand with the electricity, especially going out out, I worked with a company that had a large saline fish tank and literally we had to go out and buy its own generator for it so that if the electricity went off, the fish were still alive. So\n\nNeil McGovern (11:07):\n\nI was taking the fish eventually from school to my home every single night and weekend and it became the most unbearable, unbearable task in the entire world. So in addition to a biology teacher, I'm also one of the student council advisors here, and we are really, really, we're a very big, very active student council and it got to the point where it just became impossible."

So I used to be the environmental club advisor and I was really highly involved in that. And just to give you a little bit of background on our district, it all used to be one school, high school and district. And what happened was 21 years ago, so this was actually a while ago that I was environmental club 21 years ago, the school split because our population became really large and when the school split, they kind of looked for people to take on some responsibilities they didn't have at the time. So I was doing real well with Environmental Club, I continued to do it here.\n\nNeil McGovern (12:33):\n\nAnd so the other student council advisors, my wife as well, and I was also, you know who the boss is, it's not me. So I was also helping out with student council a lot. And once again, it got to the point where there was only so much time in the day and I felt like we all have things that are challenges for us that bring out the best in us and that interest us. And it got to the point with student council, that and environmental club is very satisfying as well, but just how passionate and active our student council are here really, really pulled me in. And when it got to the point where it was like, okay, I have a committee meeting for student council every single day except for Monday, once every other week. It was no longer fair the environmental but that.\n\nNeil McGovern (13:27):\n\nSo basically what happened is half of them joined student council anyway, came over with me, our better ones, and we have some other teachers here who had interest in doing the environmental club stuff. So I kind of passed it on to other people and they took the job and they split it amongst a couple of them, one of the club aspects of it and the other one took the enon aspects of it. So time constraints led to that, but I think I know where you got the idea of all these things Back way back, I won an award for conservation. I later the year, I'm sure it was in the poker record, the article with me holding up the little samples and living things, looking a lot younger, a whole lot younger than I do right now, which is nice. So I'm glad you saw that article if you saw the picture. Yeah, but that was, I used to do that unfortunately. Once again, like I said, I love Environmental Club.

So we're actually really early compared to what we used to be When we budget, we budget for the classes, the schedule that we currently teach and it's assumed that if your schedule teaching that right now that applies. So basically the way that we do it is there are some materials that get budgeted that go into a bid process, general classroom wise, colored pencils, markers, things like that, things that are science specific. I usually have the ability to order through non-bid sources using one of our biological suppliers, whether it's ward order a lot from right now, a lot of what we use in class, what's critical, more easy to find on their site, easy to order. We've ordered from other places. Obviously\n\nDaylene Long (18:25):\n\nYou're cutting out just a little bit. So I did, I'm sorry. That's okay.

That's correct. That's correct. So what the district does is the district has us request all of our supplies and request all of our needs for class because what they want is, and we have a large district, so it's a lot of work for 'em, is they want to make sure that before the end of the year, before the end of the calendar year, and I don't understand all the way the way because all the way why they do that because it wasn't the same a few years ago. They want it budgeted by the end of the calendar year for financial purposes, which is why they have us do our budget in October, not for the new calendar year, but right now we just did it for the 2020 4.5 school year.\n\nDaylene Long (20:13):\n\nThat makes sense.

In addition to that, there was also a science bid sheet for things that are common glassware, certain chemicals, ethyl alcohol and hydrogen peroxide and things that are, some of the stains that we use would go on bid.

So right now I'm teaching two different levels of biology, honors biology and academic biology. And I also teach zoology electives right now. In addition, sometimes I teach anatomy and physiology elective. It just depends on the year. They'll give me whatever fits in that year and I'm good with all of it. So zoology, a lot of the supplies are consumable, a lot of dissection samples, a lot of preserved samples. What I found last year is that, so the zoology class, I usually have it and for a couple years it went to another teacher because they were loading me up with biology because my kids score pretty well in the state test and they needed to move the school forward a little bit more at the time. So it was the replacement of a lot of just preserved samples that we ordered back in the year 2001 or something like that, that essentially prepared slides that we use biology wise.\n\nNeil McGovern (22:53):\n\nThere are things that we use that are the general lab activities that you're going to do in most biology classes.

So just kind of starting with the gel electrophoresis, do you have a Go-to favorite vendor that you go to for those?\n\nNeil McGovern (24:30):\n\nSo I ended up searching for a new vendor this year because one of the products I use changed a lot, so I always use Wards. Wards actually produced a kit where instead of being actual DNA samples, it was the simulated DNA samples. So one of the reasons I always did that is our supplies generally come in in the summer and there's not always somebody here to refrigerator freeze the samples that come in right away. So I was working with that for a while. So last year that kind of ended a little bit and it went to the actual DNA samples, which is also great if things go well. They came in the summer, they didn't get refrigerated and when I did gel electrophoresis, we actually got no results because the DNA was denatured pretty much I was able to locate from somebody else some remaining supplies from the former samples that we had. And once again, we did that and worked perfectly though sometimes just based on the logistics of the building and who's receiving it, when it's being stored, when it's being received, sometimes there's products that just work a little bit better because door and it's not going to be.\n\nDaylene Long (25:50):\n\nYeah.

I did that, but I believe I would actually probably have to look and let you know that, but it was a vendor that deals very specifically more with it a genetic technology. I know it wasn't Odin, they don't really let you do the Odin stuff here all the time, even though I'd like to order some of theirs. But it was another supply company, they just not as much, trying to think of who it was, but it might've been Fisher, not quite as many options as Wards had a lot of times, but had some things that they're continuing to offer that Wards doesn't really offer I'm pretty sure was bigger.\n\nDaylene Long (26:50):\n\nOkay. And then you mentioned things like beakers and chemicals and that kind of stuff. Do you remember who you typically buy those through?\n\nNeil McGovern (27:00):\n\nSo once again, when they're non-bid, they go through whatever biological supply company. So Wards seems like they've had the best prices on those last bunch of years, which is when I'm to, when you have a class that requires dissection, samples are real expensive and when you order your other samples, they're going to make you up money somewhere. So what I look for is where they're less expensive or if I need beakers, I'll order four per year for four years I have what I need, but they've been coming from wards when I do a non-bid because wards is usually usually the best price plan.\n\nDaylene Long (27:41):\n\nAnd so you usually buy once a year.

Once again, the issue for us right now is we're doing our budget in October and we're not getting the new paper catalog until January, February, maybe something or maybe the end of the year. So it ends up being just on the web. For me, the problem with the web is everything's a search and it's so time consuming to do it that way and it's wards is probably the easiest, which is why, another reason I use them a lot, but it's just, it's time consuming. You type in the item you're looking for, you get 16 different choices, you have to click on that as well to see exactly which one is what you want. Whereas in the catalog, for example, with I know with Fisher and awards and catalogs, section glassware, these three pages beakers with a chart on it that says exactly this beaker made of this material in this measurement size, and for one, this is the cost next to it for a pack of 12, here's the cost. It's just really easy to use.\n\nDaylene Long (31:52):\n\nOkay.

Then what I do is I start to look for things that are interesting that I haven't ordered before. And so I might find something with the skulls in it or some of those products and if I think it's something that I can use in a way that's engaging in class, it's active. Many times I'm at the very least going to order if it's a kit rather than get three of 'em right away when I know I would need three for my classes, I might get one and get it in one year first and get everything out and make sure it looks good, and then the next year order the other two so I can use them, use 'em with all the classes."

I believe students need to be active, a very hands-on, very minds on type of teacher. Along with that, the resource that I use right now for interactive with photosynthesis, respirations actually excellent is the bio site that has games and virtual labs on it.

I've had a blind girl in class that ended up at Harvard when she graduated here, so they're the most awesome kids ever. I love working with them. I'm kind of multimodal already, just kind of how I am a lot of times. And I think a lot of times I end up with kids that have those kind of sensory disabilities in class because I know that if they put them in with me, it's going to be a little bit easier. It's going to be maybe a little bit more visual or more. And my hearing impaired students do really, really well with visual. They do really well with hands-on, and I probably do more of that than most of the teachers in the building right now.\n\nNeil McGovern (46:45):\n\nSo they know when they come in they're going to get that. Aside from that, it really depends on the student a little bit. So I'm sure with your son, every student being impaired has a different degree of abilities with different things, whether it's visual or hands-on or things like that. And I just, especially an honor student, a high functioning student who wants to do well and just has one issue that prevents them from doing well, that's a kid you want to work with. And any of the supplies that we have, once again, making things hand on making visual, making it active, it's going to benefit every single kid having class, but it's really, really going to benefit.

I think especially for beginning teachers or teachers that are beginning to teach a certain subject. I mean, it doesn't have to be somebody straight out of school, but maybe even somebody that's been teaching like me and then all of a sudden are thrown a few days before school starts, oh, you're going to teach this kind of thing. Just even units put together. So you have more of, because you see the digital stuff for a unit and you see the, oh, well, here's a lab for teaching this concept, or here's this for that. But you don't see everything bundled together. You never see. And maybe even it would be very helpful to show, okay, here's the standards, here's the essential questions that you need to ask. Here's the I can statements and stuff like that. You don't see all that bundled together. Very seldom do you see anything like that.\n\nDaylene Long (28:15):\n\nSo you'd want something that took, I want to make sure I'm not putting words in your mouth, but something that took a topic and I don't know, pick a topic, something. Sustainability. Sustainability.\n\ndawn.parker (28:30):\n\nSustainability.\n\nDaylene Long (28:31):\n\nOkay. So you take a topic like sustainability and you put together what are the lamps that you can do? What are the simulations or digital resources that go with it? The\n\ndawn.parker (28:43):\n\nVocabulary. The\n\nDaylene Long (28:44):\n\nVocabulary,\n\ndawn.parker (28:45):\n\nThe literature you can use, Literature you can use altogether\n\nDaylene Long (28:49):\n\nWhere it's sent, maybe phenomena, that kind of thing. And then that's all kind of wrapped together is if you're teaching sustainability, Dawn, here are all the different sources you can use.\n\ndawn.parker (29:04):\n\nRight. Resources, even if it's just links to WebQuests and links to different articles and things like that. Things that you can choose from. I don't mean cookie cutter type stuff, but the choices out there for teachers that, okay, here's a lot of things that you can use and this is what each one of them covers and this is the standards that they cover and this is the essential questions you can ask. And that kind of thing.\n\nDaylene Long (29:33):\n\nThere's\n\ndawn.parker (29:33):\n\nNothing out there like that that I know of. Now you can go ahead and get, if you're buying a textbook, a lot of times the textbooks will have some of those things bundled up. Of course, they're not going to have the lab supplies and things like that unless you're actually buying labs from whatever place that is. And they'll have some of those kinds of things involved in there if you buy the kits or the workbooks and all that kind of stuff. But as far as like me, I rarely, seldom pick up a textbook. We rarely pick up a textbook. We're much more news-based and article based, like journal science news type stuff. So when I find literature, that's what I'm finding. I'm not picking up a textbook and saying, okay, read from chapter. So-And-So does so-and-So doing the word boxes instead of just like, okay, write your vocabulary definitions. We're doing things like that. And so for me, having it all bundled together and having some choices to say, okay, I want to use this and I want to use that, but I've got something better than for this thing, so I'm not going to use this one, and oh, I want to do that lab out of three.\n\ndawn.parker (30:41):\n\nThat kind of thing.\n\nDaylene Long (30:42):\n\nSo it's kick-starting things for teachers who might have adopted or adapted a new lesson that they haven't done before because teachers like yourself who've been doing this for a while, you kind of know, I want to use this resource here and this one here, but not that one. But would you also use this resource for new ideas if there were, okay.\n\ndawn.parker (31:05):\n\nYes."

So we do have an opportunity that our supervisor asks earlier if there's any larger ticket items that we'd like.

Can you talk a little bit more about that? Well, and some of it's festered. I mean, I pay a lot of attention to motivation because that's what my research was in, but the motivation to learn is really not there. And coupled with something better to do, such as being on a phone that's an instant replacement. It's one thing to go to sleep or sit and doodle, but now there's something entirely different to do. Okay. \n\nDaylene Long (22:34):\n\nSo let's talk about the motivation first. Why do you think that has changed? \n\nElliott Karetny (22:47):\n\nI think it's changed in general, and I don't know how much of it's changed rather than just become more kind of crystallized in terms of grades and points. And it's a very, I mean, I love Palo Free air and the idea of that it's just accounting and it's just numbers and it's just a work a day thing. And so with that in mind, the education really has no, doesn't have as much purpose either. And in my eyes as well as the kids' eyes, if they wanted to learn something, which a lot of them, they just do, cannot find something they want to learn about. So there's a real absence of curiosity of a spark. Creativity is really lacking. They just cannot draw something, they cannot use a ruler. So there's so much missing to their humanity. And I think that's a lot of it. And then throw in a course like environmental science, which focuses on things like climate change, which, and I love tracking it year after year that climate change has always been a difficult thing to teach and it changes how and why it's difficult. But yeah, it's a really rough world that they're trying to grow up in any way, but they can't articulate that unless I draw it out of \n\nDaylene Long (24:20):\n\nSo did you see these changes before Covid?"

The other thing I wanted to talk about with you was you're teaching a topic that on the environmental science side of things, talk to me a little bit about what you think is missing in terms of supplies or activities or even big picture. And I bring this up because one, I know that environmental science courses are increasing across the US in terms of more people taking them. And I personally have a 21-year-old son who every time he comes home from college tells me exactly how my generation has ruined the earth and that his generation is going to have to clean it all up. So that's why they need to know about these things. So I'm a little biased I will say on that, but I'm also just kind of wondering, when you're looking five years, 10 years out, what kind of shifts need to happen in education for students?"

And I switched gears and I just threw it into the lesson that was about fracking, and I was like, this is what we should be doing. I said, how much do you think it's going to, I talked about it with my green team because they were concerned that it's going to become a warehouse that a series of warehouses, And that's what's going to happen to this land now that it's been bought. But that's the kind of thing, I mean, my research and my work is really dedicated towards, I'm tired of the phrase empowerment, but it's really activating the kids. I don't want the kids to have to wait until they're old enough to vote once every four years. But the more people that get involved, the more people can change things.

When I was just redesigning an osmosis lab, just teaching osmosis this week to kids, there are so many relevant things, whether it's my mom's dialysis or a kid drinking juice that had chlorophyll in it, but everything kept popping up as relevant. But if I was to take out the dialysis tubing that I used my first year teaching and have them spend 20 minutes trying to open it apart and do the starch and the iodine, what is any of that for? I mean, it's hard for product development because a lot of the stuff should be like kitchen kind, science, what can you find in the garage and tinker with? So it's hard, I guess the product developers could make, and some of it could be a different kind of game or different kind of manipulatives that were more affordable. I guess a lot of it's about the manipulatives really, the individual hands-on things. I've got to set a lungs over there and I've got a foam virus that comes apart and things like that.

I try to do a lot of peer to peer learning, I guess you would call it, just to keep kids involved and keep, because there's always a kid who's racing the head, there's always a kid who's days behind.

So I applied for several grants and got money from the school and grants and I just bought models, dissection things for them to dissect because it's hard to tell them that the heart does this if they don't know what a heart actually looks like. So it's like we're defeating the purpose and showing them a picture in a textbook, that's great, but nothing beats like a model or dissecting a frog, dissecting a pig and actually seeing the heart and taking the heart out. So every time that I gain get money, then I buy models or dissecting kits or specimens, something that can help them because if they're going into medicine, even though it is a school in Philadelphia and we're not funded the way a suburban school, they still should get the exact same quality education as someone who is in the suburbs.

Because we're a district school, we're not quite funded. You have to maximize the money that they give to you.

So for me as a bio lead, then I can say, okay, well these are the additional things that I need so everyone can get something. But obviously the chem teacher is not going to use a fetal pig, whereas I would actually need it. So you do have sub funding and then you can go outside and get grants on different things to help you pay for additional stuff, which is pretty much what I did.

It wasn't much, so that's why I had to go and get an additional grant to substitute for everything else. \n\nDaylene Long (24:21):\n\nWell, it's great that you have the skills to be able to do that.

I look at it that way. \n\nDaylene Long (24:56):\n\nYeah, that's great. One of the things that came up in the survey is we talked about what makes a vendor reliable or trustworthy for you, and can you talk a little bit about what's really important to you from vendors to consider them reliable and trustworthy? So \n\nBio Nicole Evans (25:19):\n\nBesides money, obviously money is probably going to be the number one factor, but if the kits are worth it because you can buy a kit and you're still trying to figure out what do they want me to do with this, I bought kits and the way that they assemble it, this is not for high school, it's not for our high school. So I think trustworthiness, excluding price is to understand that if you develop a kit, make sure that the wording, everything is beneficial to every school. And to understand that my students are not going to be on the same level as someone who's in a suburb. So if they have kids that I know or quality kits that I know my students are going to understand it and I know they're not going to have any difficulties with it. I think that goes along with trust.

And I also feel that the kids or some of them assume that they come in with some knowledge, but if they're getting physical science before my class, which has really nothing to do with biology whatsoever, then that's a lot of learning curve that these students have to do. And if they've never, because to be honest in Philadelphia, most of the science classes is watching a Bill Knight or something like that. So they don't really get, it's focusing on reading and math until when they get to high school. Then the high school focus on science. So prior to high school it's about reading and math. So then now I'm throwing out all these biology content and they're looking at me, what am I talking about? So it's just to make sure that when kids are done, it is like you have to also take that into context as well that the language just can't be on that level because we do have some high schoolers that are not performing on their level."

So I think that has definitely, I mean, there isn't anything wrong with the phones, but they're not using the phones for the right ability.

I think if it's connected to the boards and they can problem solve or they can do little animations to help them, I think that that will be definitely beneficial because me telling them osmosis high to low and they're like, okay, why do I have to learn this? But I think maybe they could do an animation or do something that helps them, or even a virtual cell on their phones and they can see water coming in and out and they can manipulate that. I think that would be beneficial. Something that they can actually see versus just reading this or looking at a picture. That's \n\nDaylene Long (40:16):\n\nInteresting.

How do you feel about that? \n\nBio Nicole Evans (40:28):\n\nI, I think that time has come and gone. I think maybe when we were growing up then maybe phones should not be used. I don't think that phones should be taken away because it is technology and the world that we're going to in virtual reality and all of that, that is technology and that is a skill that they can take beyond high school. So taking away the phone is that the world is going forward and we're trying to take them backwards. So I don't think that that is the right way, but what I do think is that we should develop maybe virtual programs again, that if we're sitting here talking to them about a cell, that there's a virtual thing about a cell that they can manipulate and they can see how that works outside of the body, I think that's better.

So when the teachers came back, they had that full, whatever it was. I think it was a three and a half hour part of the day that they had the intro. Again, basically the full intro into the program might've been June or July. We did that. I think we did it before the actual school year started, but that was part of the payment.

Not really because I think that there's a lot of extra that I'm not even going to look at. So to me, it's a waste of trees. And I mean, I'm not a tree hugger, but I also don't like to have it lying around because I already have so much other stuff.\n\nKelda Bailess (22:13):\n\nSo online where I can type it in and I can just say forensics and it, it has those keywords of things that are connected to that. Because when I just say go on a website to search for a product, I like it when there's other things that I might not have remembered or thought of, but because it has that keyword connected to it, it's going to pop up and I'm going to be like, oh yeah, I could use that.

I teach them prefixes and suffixes, and I start at the very beginning. So I'm old school and do notebooks and they use colored ink because the color, it's going to make it stick in your brain. Writing it out is way better than taking digital notes. And they see that once they get to the end of the year, but I make them have a part of their notebook that sectioned off for their vocabulary or their glossary define. We don't go through and say, okay, now define this list of words. But as we go through them when we're learning content, we always hit on those prefixes and suffixes and drilling that in. Then when they approach test questions or essays or anything like that with that in there, then they have a good foundation to figure out what they're trying to read or what they're trying to understand. But I would say that so many of our kids have gotten the short end of the stick with labs. I think virtual labs is a great idea if you're in a position where you can't go to a lab or if you don't have time.

This looks like you're right there at that surgery and you're able to manipulate tools. I think they would take it more seriously.\n\nDaylene Long (43:55):\n\nOkay. That's really interesting.

And really the goal on this is that we have a client who wants to know how to make it better for educators are the things that they can provide that would make it better for your teaching or make it better for students.

Live red worms. In order to maintain my compost bins, currently my students have aquatic e I'm looking around my room currently. My students have aquatic ecosystem set up and they're testing for nutrient cycling. So your nitrogen, your phosphorus, your sulfur compounds, and how the different organisms contribute to those. And so they monitor the levels week by week. I use aloia in biology so the students can observe plant cells under the microscope. So those are some of the ways that we use live items.\n\nSpeaker 1 (05:41):\n\nSo besides the fact that it's part of the standards, I bet I'm guessing that your students are really interested in the topics that you're teaching. It sounds like you're connecting to a lot of their\n\nSpeaker 3 (05:57):\n\nWell, I think the live items help them to connect. It's real, it's tangible. It's not just a preserved specimen or a slide that's been prepared. So they feel like they're more connected to the material and I think it helps them remember the content better.\n\nSpeaker 1 (06:13):\n\nThat's interesting. Okay.

And so I always have two or three weeks after the AP test where you're like, what am I going to do? And so that's where I try and push them for, you took this class for a reason. You've hopefully gotten your AP credit. Where are we going to go from here? And so whatever their interest is in environmental science, which is a huge spectrum, I try and have them choose something and then do a project with it. So maybe an internship. So one year I had a girl who wanted to be an architect, so she went and found an architect in the Houston area who was focused on sustainable methods of forestry. She helped them find better lumberyards that used more harvestable timber that was better for the planet. And then they actually started changing the way that they designed buildings to use the better lumber in different ways and wrote a paper about it, which was really fascinating. And I don't know anything about architecture, but it was interesting to learn.\n\nDaylene Long (20:46):\n\nWhat a wonderful, that's really interesting. Any others that you can think of?\n\nReade Burke (20:55):\n\nI've had some students do some really cool projects with Arduino, which is something they can code to do different things. A lot of students are focused on recycling efforts. Our campus does not because it's not cost effective in our region. We're trying to encourage our food and nutrition department to switch away from styrofoam trays in the lunchroom. So students are advocating for that. That's something they started this week. I had a student a few years ago who found a way to make reusable expo markers so you could just pull the tube out from the middle. And so they made a product design. They were like, teachers throw these away all the time, and they're not really recyclable. They get thrown out of the facilities. So I was like, mean, those are good ideas.\n\nDaylene Long (21:39):\n\nAnd those are the kind of global challenges that kids that are in high school right now are going to be needing to deal with. My son is 21 and he mentions from time to time that prior generations have ruined the entire planet for him and that he and his generation that are going to have to deal with a lot of the fallout from it. And I see that in a lot of the projects you're talking about there. So that's interesting. Let me see what else I've got on here. Okay.

After the test? So we do RTI on our campus, so trying to scaffold them up just depending on when they're failing, hopefully before December, because that's kind of a big checkpoint. As far as what could a vendor do? It just kind of depends on the teaching style in my opinion. There are some teachers that flourish really well with prepackaged information and they can apply that to their students. I find that, I mean, I work at a very multicultural school.

History hasn't changed, and those books are going to be a fixed cost, but eventually I'm going to need more fennel failing. And that's going to be something that is consistent. And so sometimes, and this is true with a lot of my friends in teaching across multiple districts, public and private charter schools, they don't understand that you can't just take your budget and divide it across departments. Like all departments are not created equal. And I feel that our society is moving towards STEM. That has been a 15-year-old shift. And so if we want to continue to have research for Covid and push for these things, we need to have children interested in bench based research. And if they don't have exposure to it at 15 and they have an attention span built on TikTok, they're not going to have the attention to solve cancer to find RNA.

So I had honors biology students and my goal for them is differentiate from regular bio and do more labs, making sure sometimes we would do a couple labs a week on materials and time, but we would have to have all of our money spent. So we'd get it in January and then have until the following year, and usually by the end of October, they want us to spend all the money by that point in time, so everything could be in at least have everything ordered, I guess by that time. So by the time December rolled around, they could close out the books for that year. So I always made sure I spent all the money and then I'd ask if anybody else had any money they hadn't spent in their departments typically. And I would dissection materials. Cats were really difficult to come by, dissect the cats from anatomy class for I don't know how many years. I did that a lot.

I wasn't the only one that was spending the money. I tried to get them to, as they use something up, write it down for ordering supplies. If we needed something, we'd order it. If the money was there, it was easy to order. And I got together with Flynn and they gave us our school corporation, a 10% discount and free shipping. And we went up with the contract with them, and we spent most of our money there. They didn't have a couple of the specimens and some of the live stuff that I used, but once that happened and some of the other companies kind of switching a little bit, that was a big thing. Free shipping on some of those things. Free shipping on 50 pigs is quite a nice break. \n\nDaylene Long (14:15):\n\nYeah, \n\nmike (14:15):\n\nWe would do that. I just have a Question.

You can come in whenever, but yeah, I would go in and do it. \n\nDaylene Long (14:55):\n\nOkay. I have a question about Flynn. So you mentioned that they gave you a 10% discount. Did that come negotiated through the district or through your school? \n\nmike (15:13):\n\nI just set it up, I don't even know. It's been a few years now. We've used it for a while.

We didn't have a lot of choices on some of the stuff I did use, I can't remember the company, we got it from a couple of cameras that go on top of the microscope and you can plug 'em right into your computer. I got two of those. We had a kid that was visually impaired and the microscope was not going to be something that he was going to be able to look directly into. So both the classrooms he was in, I had a little camera that he could use and still be able to participate. It's a"

Frost (09:55):\n\n23, 24 because we were finished. We had just completed in May. We had just completed the 2223 school year and we were preparing for this current school year, which we're finished with the first half. Actually, today is our last day.\n\nDaylene Long (10:19):\n\nSo\n\nL. Frost (10:20):\n\nYes. And so we just look at, this is a list of the labs that we wanted to do this past year. This is what we did, this is what we didn't do, this is what I wish I had different. So we go through that whole thing and we just kind of make a shopping list. Will we need beakers, will we need, and most of the time it's chemicals that we will need for different types of tests and those sometimes consumable type things like that. But for activities, I have some beads and pipe cleaners that I use to build DNA key chains and do mitosis and miosis with kind of manipulatives. And so they don't just have a picture to look at.

I don't know how all of that works on the budgeting end and with our school board and how all of that works. But we usually have, and we're a small school, but we have a couple thousand dollars to work with a lot of times and it depends on what we want and we will kind of say, Hey, I would like to do this. And if we set up a plan, if it's something like I want to do a DNA gel electrophoresis for example, and I want to get a couple of those test kits. And so if it's something of a large expense plus that would be something we only use once and each semester or something that that's a larger purchase just for one activity. And so if I want to do that, we'll put that in the budget for, we'll do that for this year, or we'll say we can't do it this year, we'll cut back and then I'll plan to do it next year or the next year or something like that.\n\nDaylene Long (15:53):\n\nSo\n\nL.

So maybe if you're up there and you're teaching about sickle cell anemia that you, I don't know. I guess what I'm hearing from you is that students are accessing multiple ways of getting and assessing information. So are there things that you feel are missing that you wish you had?"

And so I myself have not dissected in years, about eight years I'm guessing. But biology two is a survey of the kingdoms, the different kingdoms and lum with plants, animals, fungus, all of that. And so they do more dissection.\n\nDaylene Long (36:51):\n\nOkay. So do you know what has driven that change that the biology one, there's less dissection\n\nL. Frost (37:00):\n\nTesting. It's going to be my number one answer. The testing, everything is so heavy on testing and I think that at this point, whether it's at the national level, the state level, whatever is that your test results are the quickest way to prove this is what I know. And some kids do not test well. I've known really, really smart kids that don't test well and I've known lazy kids that soak it all up and then they test like their geniuses and then later on they're flipping burgers at McDonald's or something. And so I don't know that testing is the best measure of somebody's knowledge or their ability, but I feel like we are heavily leaning on those tests and test results more than anything."

I haven't looked specifically because I just find Tennessee standards and click it and then I go find biology and then I start clicking and pulling out questions. So that makes it nice when I'm going to do a review and put 'em on teams, put the kids in teams and I can just click, this is our standard that we're learning about and I need 10 questions, click, click, click and pull 'em over. And then I've got it pulled up on my TV right here and the kids can buzz in or write their answer down on their little dry erase boards and it makes it easier. And I appreciate having that as an, I don't want to say it's new. I've had it for about three or four years with our county and district and that's made things a lot more simple so I can grab and go pretty quickly.\n\nDaylene Long (44:54):\n\nAnd I apologize for my cat who's decided To be Part of this phone call.

It was in my desperate search for online labs because they also dropped Adobe Flash payer stopped working and so then all of a sudden all of these labs that we previously used that worked online no longer worked. So we had this problem where we were great. Now all of our kids at home, we need online labs and none of our online labs work.

They fit well with our curriculum and they were kind of interactive, so I liked that. So we started getting them, we tried it out for the year and we found that it fit in well with our curriculum. So when we got back, when we were all back in person, we decided to budget for that and keep that in there so we could keep using it. I just did one today with my environmental students. It was on household energy usage, so they're able to click on different items in a house and see how many watts of energy it uses and they're able to do calculations. So stuff like that's handy where it's a little bit more interactive than me just giving them a sheet that says here's all these facts. They click through different rooms, they can manipulate the data themselves.\n\nDaylene Long (15:41):\n\nDo you find there's other distractions with the iPad or is it pretty focused or?

One kid today in Environmental was watching a video of wrestling and I had to go over and be like, no, that's not what we're doing right now. It's different with the different levels that I teach. So my cp, my lower level classes, I give them their work on paper still and they'll use their iPads kind of as more support. My accelerated students do everything on their iPad. They don't get paper, they write everything they use notability write in there, they'll open up the stuff, whatever educational tools we're using, it's all on. There's nothing on paper so they can still get distracted, but it's quick to notice and you kind of learn quickly which kids are more likely to get sidetracked and start watching a video or doing whatever else it is they want to do. And because they're iPads, we can use Apple Classroom so I can pull up their screens while they're in class and watch their screens. So they took a test in biology yesterday on mitosis in Google Forms and as they're taking their test, I have all their screens on my iPad in front of me and I can see where they are so they can be monitored still. They still try watch videos and do other things they shouldn't, but they're relatively good at staying on task\n\nDaylene Long (17:04):\n\nActually. You're brilliant. I mean, yes.

I might for next year I'm going to probably look for stuff for environmental science.

So they've done, I'm looking at my files, ecology populations, biodiversity and energy so far and I have some labs in energy already, but I could use a few in earlier units. They did one yesterday using solar panels that I only kind of liked. So I actually did a quick search for solar panel kits the other day to try to find a better lab. I didn't find anything that fit what I wanted, so I kind of tossed that off to the side, but I just kind of look to see what is out there that might fit. Would it fit in any of those units? They're going to talk about water next. I think that we already have a few water labs, but is there anything else that I like? Can I find a lab that will cover some of our standards and fits in with the unit we're teaching, stuff like that.\n\nDaylene Long (28:41):\n\nYou mentioned both Carolina and Flynn, so when you're now looking at next year for environmental science, will you start with those two or do you do a Google search just to see what's out in the universe?

        "snippet":"Ms. Murray (35:27):\n\nI think definitely being able to include more hands-on activities in different units particularly we just did or I did in some of my classes I'm about to do in others myosis. I have a student teacher this year and I was joking with her that this is my seventh year trying to teach myosis and crossing over and I still have not found a lab that I like. I've made my own, I've edited other ones, still have not found something. So ideally finding things that actually work to effectively teach my students all of the concepts in hands-on ways because myosis is complicated. So last year I made a lab where they used pipe cleaners to model each step of myosis and they did not get it. It went right over their heads and I was like, all right, I spent days making this lesson that I'm going to throw in the trash and never try again because tried it three times, failed three times was like, okay.\n\n(36:25):\n\nAnd so I'm still looking for better. I have a crossing lab for my accelerated level kids that I think works for them, but I'm still working on trying to find one for my lower level students and they offer or they present more challenges a lot of the time because the concepts have to be made more basic and there's often more behavioral concerns as well. So the lesson needs to be easy enough that they can follow. It needs to be engaging enough that they will stay on task and it can't have materials that they can throw at one another or cause danger, which it's hard to get all of those things.\n\nDaylene Long (37:01):\n\nSo in a theoretical amazing world, I would love to have lots of activities like that\n\nMs. Murray (37:05):\n\nThat can be done without them causing chaos. And of course it's a mix. It's not like it's just the materials, it's the students and the materials and you have to find the right balance because I have certain groups of kids, I have a group this year that would not throw materials at one another. They would probably be okay, but they need kind of those more basic concepts. Last year they could probably handle more challenging concepts, but they would throw things at one another and so it needed to be more of they had to be vigilantly watched to make sure that they would follow along.\n\nDaylene Long (37:39):\n\nI\n\nMs. Murray (37:40):\n\nDo labs. I use a lot of beans for different things. I can, can't think of an example right now. My environmental students count them when we talked about populations and tagging species to calculate potential population size. So that's one that comes to mind. And then I end up with beans everywhere and my accelerated students in environmental are a little bit older. They're more mature, mostly less likely to throw them at one another. But even stuff like that, they throw it at one another. So that's kind of my cheat to a lot of activities is that I use random materials like that. Anyway, back to your initial question."

The only time that it comes to be a little bit of a problem is when they do a lab. For my students that were absent from environmental yesterday, I had the data.

My environmental kids used a protractor yesterday. I went around to be like, do we know how to use a protractor?

They'll try to hide AirPods underneath, they'll tuck it in their ear and then they'll cover with their hair or they'll try to block it.

And some of my classes, we start and I'm like, it's January. Every single day we meet, we do the same thing. I'm like, yet I don't see enough iPads. And then they'll take them out and they get going.

I don't have to make a lot of changes, so I can go and edit a couple of things and it's set and it's ready to go. Other things that I buy, it's like the materials here are great, but I have to make a whole lesson to go along with it.

I am originally an agriculture education teacher,\n\nSarah Webster (11:30):\n\nBut there were no positions open in my area when I was applying. So I started out teaching biology. I then moved to teaching bio and earth and space. Then our school did away with earth and space. So then I picked up environmental and I had been teaching biology and environmental science ever since. This year I was moved to part-time in-person teaching part-time virtual teaching. Our county has implemented a new behavioral program that these kids are in a in-school suspension setting. And so we have to teach everything to them virtually. So they're sitting in a room, they're zooming into me sitting in my office teaching. So this has been a whole year of change.\n\nDaylene Long (12:22):\n\nWow. The program that you're talking about with the in class suspension is really interesting. Do you know of other schools that do that or is this something that is new for you guys?\n\nSarah Webster (12:35):\n\nThis is completely new to us. We have an alternative school as well. So this is kind of how it was explained to us is the teachers. It's a pre-step to going to that long-term term\n\nDaylene Long (12:52):\n\nKind of a pilot Maybe?\n\nSarah Webster (12:53):\n\nYeah, I mean we're definitely piloting it the first and the classes change every four and a half weeks. So we get a whole new group of kids at the middle of a marking term and then a whole new group of kids at the end of the marking term going into the next marking term. So every four and a half weeks my kids change.\n\nDaylene Long (13:16):\n\nSo I would imagine that's a challenge. Yes. Yeah. I intend to start here, but I would love to know how it is. How do you do hands-on labs then with them if they're remote or is that not? So\n\nSarah Webster (13:36):\n\nThe hands-on labs, a lot of it I have had to tailor them to items that they're going to have at home or things that are honestly cheap and disposable that our school can send, put little lab kits together and send to them. And so it definitely takes a lot of preparation on my part is figuring out what I'm going to do, what those hands-on labs that I'm going to do during that four and a half weeks are so that their lab kits are ready at the beginning of that four and a half weeks.\n\nDaylene Long (14:17):\n\nYeah, that's really interesting. I skipped over one of the parts where I just kind of give you the basics of what we're doing today and I don't want to do that. Skip over that. It's good information for you. We are recording. It's just for note taking purposes. I promise you won't end up on YouTube and I'm not going to ask you to do a TikTok dance or"

And so I had the challenge because in the long run I have three preps and no prep period to be able to get into my actual in-person classroom because it is used all day long. So whatever I prep gets prepped at my desk,\n\nDaylene Long (24:40):\n\nThat is an extra challenge. I think that's really interesting and I really appreciate that you went through all the different things that you have to consider when you're sending the kit home because it's a different set of circumstances. How do you handle safety issues?"

They're going to be assessed on the open-ended questions, but it's going to be graded by ai. Is that going through the district, the state? Do you have a sense of that?\n\nSarah Webster (42:29):\n\nFrom what we're being told, our test is, I'm pretty sure the owner, the publisher of the test is through I think Pearson. So I know in the past they have had teachers work in the week after the test to grade the written responses as far as on the state level.

And so definitely things that are maybe more shelf stable meaning so that I could set them up three or four days in advance because once a week I do have an additional 40 minutes that I am able to be in that classroom, but I can't necessarily teach or do labs, so I could use that as additional prep time.\n\nDaylene Long (46:48):\n\nSo this is just me not being a teacher.

I'm very excited for it. I'm a PhD dropout. I was the person who was like, oh, everyone's telling me that I want to get my PhD and I'm just going to go along in the path. And I didn't fall out of love with science. I fell out of love with the business of science and really, really intense research and I was just doing a lot of reflection on what I got out of science and how much I enjoyed it. And it all really came back to teachers. So I just really wanted to contribute back into that system if I myself couldn't go through a PhD, but if I inspired one student in my years to get one, cool. If I do two, I've doubled myself. So I just really think that when it comes to science education in particular, there's such a need for experiential teaching and experiential learning. There's a lot of interesting ways to teach science and I'm one of those people who likes to work with the hands-on approach rather than the, I tell you things. I would rather that the kids discover stuff. So that's where I'm really coming from with things in bio.\n\nKimberly Herder (05:59):\n\nVery cool. How long have you been teaching? This"

And then it's designing stuff around those questions. Now, granted being a sneaky teacher, I know what their questions are going to be. So one of the phenomenon that I selected, for example, is cancer. So it's not a happy thing, but it evokes interest and that for the most part, I know what your average 14, 15-year-old is going to be asking about that disease and what they want to know. So once I get those questions, that's what I start with. Whenever I'm working off of designing or working with or deciding what I'm going to be using and purchasing in materials is to see if those are things that are going to directly lead to an experience to my students being able to answer those questions that they have as scientists."

Well it turns out that what's just using my knowledge and my background information, I reason oh well is so it's really two options. It's either healing from injury or rapid cell growth, which is cancer.

So for a fruit fly lab, for example, as opposed to buying all the individual pieces, I guess I am reflecting now on how much kits are nice when I am able to get them, as opposed to me just being like, oh, I need to do a standard bacteria lab and I'm ordering agar from one place and Petri dishes from another place. And then I have all the little, I have all the beakers and stuff and oh, I need Kim wipes, and then it'll like, where am I ordering that from? So a lot of little things or then swabs, where's that coming from? And I don't really have the time to do price comparison stuff.

I'm not a real lab, I'm a lab light. So when need Petri dishes, I don't know why there's 200 kinds of Petri dishes and it's infuriating. Like I'm just an educator. I need the basic stuff. I don't need the crazy, crazy sterile one. I don't need the glass. I just need the ones that are good for 14 year olds. I'm going to get the cheap ones. I'm going to get the cheap ones. It's not that hard. Just give me an option, please, to sort by education purposes or something. That would be nice. I don't need the bougie stuff. They're 14 year olds.

So it's a kit where we're getting live specimens of hydras and there's individual units. Ideally it would be something that I open up and everything. It's kind of like Ikea, e, where it's like here all the parts, they're labeled for every single group they need an A, B, A C, A D. That's what I'm doing. So as a science teacher, it's like I have these, and I think most teachers do this, but I have trays, they're little low trays and I fill it up with all the supplies kind of thing. And then those get distributed to all of my lab stations. But there is a core teacher station where I'm just like, okay, everyone gets a graduated cylinder, everyone gets a beaker, everyone gets this, and then it's right, it goes back out. So yeah, something that's a little bit more clear on that, I suppose."

So what was I saying?\n\nKimberly Herder (45:53):\n\nDifferentiating?\n\nMr. Ruber-Strohm (45:55):\n\nDifferentiating, yes. In the real world, differentiation is done live. I am going over and giving that group what it is that they need in that moment or that student, what they need. I usually don't have as much physical differentiation or at least nothing that's super obvious. If I do differentiate and it's physical, maybe for example, it's like I'm giving students a glossary. Everyone gets the glossary. No one's being singled out for being like, here's this glossary for you. And then some kids choose to use it or not. Particularly in my school, we don't have tracking. So in my classroom, I have students at the fourth grade reading level and the 12th grade reading level. So that kind of results in a lot of needed self differentiation or I in the moment need to switch on a different hat when I'm talking with them and discussing things with them. So if it was something that was just built into a kit, my God, that'd be cool, especially if it's something that's subtle, something that another group wouldn't look over and be like, why is yours written differently? Or Why is yours already premeasured or something. I don't know exactly what that would be. But in terms of most skills that need to be differentiated is reading. That's really the big one. Yeah. Comprehension."

I would want it to be something where it's like, cool, I'm going to order one of those for me to try out for myself because I'm going to do it at least once for myself to try it out. Ideally, it's the exact same thing that the kids would have. And then what's like if I end up liking it, I'm able to order it in units of lab groups. That would be amazing. And then ultimately, as you were saying, if it came with worksheets and stuff, again, in my reality, I would probably take that worksheet and I'd make my own from it. I would be spinning it into whatever my particular storyline is, and there's just really no way to, as far as I know, there's no way to customize it that easily."

I personally enjoyed the discussion of students being like, well, I didn't see that. And then a lot of the labs that we do, or at least that I did in high school, were fake labs. We were told that this is what's happening, but actually the teacher might've added baking. He had added secret little things to make the results happen the way that we wanted to.

Why don't we think it worked? And that's not error analysis. I mean, it's partly error analysis, but it's also like, well, where did we mess up? What did they do differently? What didn't you take seriously? There's life lessons to be learned there. It's actually ridiculous that when students are like, what do you mean a PhD takes eight years? It's like, well, it's not like you're just showing up and doing lab time. You're like, this was made for you. This was someone's PhD thesis in the thirties. This has been tested for you. So I actually appreciate variation in results. I appreciate variability and even a little bit of flexibility if possible. Heaven forbid, and this is slightly different thing, but it'd be cool if even if the kits that gave students choice in whatever that lab might be, giving them a little bit of flexibility and like, do you want to go this? You could do this, you could do this. You could see what happens here. It depends on the specific lab, but realistically, at the end of the day, my students are not going to remember the scientific facts. They're going to remember the experience and the skills that they're getting out of it. And in some cases, again, it's not, this is how you measure with a beaker. Oh, it's important that I'm paying attention when I'm measuring out anything basic lessons. But those are the lessons that need to be learned\n\nKimberly Herder (53:42):\n\nAnd that they'll remember that part too. Yes. Okay. Well, thank you. We went over time and I apologize for that.
