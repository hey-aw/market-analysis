Of range are you usually working with?

Educator (06:09):

Usually between 1000 and $2,000. It sort of depends upon how the classes get divvied up and if there's something that somebody bought last year and they feel like, well this year I'm in pretty good stead that then they sort of let it go to somebody else. But then the other thing back to your previous question in terms of purchasing is that in terms of purchase orders and authorized vendors is that it's very set cut and dried if person's not on a vendor list. And this little publisher that did the additional supplemental materials for my AP was not on that list. So again, that sort of was the impetus for me to use my own money because I knew I wouldn't get money from some other source to do that. Yeah.

Interviewer 1 (07:01):

What's the name of that little publisher they're talking about?

Educator (07:03):

It's called the Apes. It's got a weird name. It's called the Apes House Capital a PES house. And it's sort of a consortium of environmental teachers who follow along and track along with the regular AP set curriculum that comes out from the college board and gives you some supplemental things that you can do beyond some of the stuff that they have you do.

Reason that I chose to do that this year was because I thought it would make my job easier throughout the rest of the year.

Well, the kits, well in part the kits themselves, we always get the thing in terms of our sort of professional development is that if it's all there in a kit, is that the kit just has to open up the cookbook and do X, Y, Z and hopefully that you come out with a result. And even if they design it themselves, and I've had some experience, and actually I probably had the more experience with the kids and if I'm getting too tangential, just say redirect is that, for example, I had a really great last year, I had a really great special ed teacher. We did more student-centered science projects with the expectation that whatever that was, they found out if they found out that their thesis, their hypothesis, their whatever it was was wrong, they were okay with it because then the whole point of it was then to go back and to do it again and reform whatever it was you were looking for. And it was real simple stuff. It didn't have to be real complex, but I thought there was a lot more learning going on within that group of students than there were even with my AP kids because they were, that's a whole nother Fail.

Those, well first of all, mostly if we're trying to do things that are student-based in terms of student-based learning is we're for the most part discouraged from buying kits. So there's a kit for pollution and landfill percolation in terms of things like getting into the streams and things like that. Well, I mean you can go to Flynn and you can get student kit and it comes and you unwrap the plastic and boom, there's sort of this whole thing. They're really wanting students to sort of figure it out for themselves and what kind of materials to do that themselves. However, the thing that has happened, and I've seen this mostly in the last 10 years, is that, alright, I'm going to be the old guy from who graduated high school in the eighties who says we used lab equipment when we did labs, we didn't use the thermometer that you would use to check and see whether your chicken is at 165 to go out into the lawn and do different levels of temperature in that.

Educator (12:53):

There's a lot of that in science now, even in terms of like, oh, let's figure out the different layers of soil by using pudding and gram crackers. I mean that's just greats against me. This is stuff maybe that we would've done, I would've done in elementary school, not in a high school science class.

Why do you think it is then that the district prefers to go with these science education companies rather than an Amazon?

I don't know. That is a good question because that's a question of many teachers to the district about that. Well

Interviewer 1 (29:37):

That's interesting, but you don't have a personal preference. If you could, you'd get things from Amazon.

Educator (29:43):

Oh yeah, absolutely. Even with, we have a little tiny little budget of funds that are ongoing. We call it quite a slush fund, but it's sort of like monies that sort of get accumulated for various things is that that can be used. But again, that's used for something 20, $30.

Nice to be able to say, I trained for this, but I'm going to take a left turn here or right turn here. I'm going to get back by teaching. I like that it wasn't that way when I was growing up and I like the fact that it's that way now.

Educator (36:16):

Yeah, I mean a different age. My dad who's now in his eighties, he was with the same company for 40 years, retired from there. There wasn't a sort of branching out into anything else. So yeah, it was time for a change and I went from, I'm associated with the Lutheran church, ELCA Lutheran church, but my population is 70% African-American, about 20% Latino, 10% other things including Caucasian. But again, how things are changing is that we're getting a lot more Latino Spanish speaking students or multi-language learner, what they used to call ESL, multi-language learners.

But within the budget, and once the budget is approved for say large materials like big purchase orders, then from there they give the task to the committees. And sometimes you actually have a person that's over the science people that actually handles ordering the big, especially textbooks and all of those type things. And they task the science coordinators to help bring people in to be able to review the materials. And we have rubrics for that. And then from there, whatever we ask for or we come to a conclusion, then that goes then into the board for their final approval.

Right. Well, generally, and I can't really say the exact at this point, the exact dollar amount. When we order something, if it's over $4,000, we have to, there's a few extra steps that we have to do. I'm sorry, over $5,000. There's a few steps that we have to do. And once again, that changes from time to time is to what you need to do. Sometimes it might be you have to get more than one quote if you're going to purchase something that's over that amount.

What kind of things do you do in your life

Interviewer 1 (19:57):

Science courses for hands-on activities?

Educator (20:03):

Well, a lot of things are based on phenomena, so the hands-on activities. It is kind of like twofold. We use, our district pretty much uses the five E lesson model, and so within that five engaged part, you're doing some type of phenomenon. So it could be something that the students can manipulate. It could be something that just really a phenomenon based type thing. And that is what really would be, is helpful to teachers to be able to have some type of something that would fit our standards that's phenomenon so that the students engages them. And then from that engagement, then you can teach your lesson, but at the same time, then later if you're doing a lab activity that's an application or a lab activity connect, then that would be the second type of hands-on type or something that students could manipulate. So it could actually be, I mean honestly and truly don't really like kits because to me it's just like the cookbook, but it has to be something that's more inquiry where the students are being able to be part of it, not like, okay, follow follow these steps. So if the kit or if the material that's within a kit allows for students to be able to expand their learning, then that's good. But if it's just, okay, here, take this, take. That to me is too cookbook ish and I don't like, I personally don't use those. I would take maybe some of those materials and then I change it around and adapt it more to a standard space five E science phenomenon type lesson.

Same time, roughly the same time was really looking for a way to do digital labs. Different reason though, the school I worked at North Division, I had God, there was days, there was classes that I taught that had a 50% attendance rate, so it was really rough and I brought Google Classroom to my school. I went to a conference in my, oh god, when was that? 2015. I went to a conference and I saw somebody using Google Classroom and I'm like, this is awesome. I want to do this. And nobody in my school was doing it and they're just like, well, I guess if we can figure it out. So I wanted to find something that could attach to that as well. So I pushed to get the funding to get gizmos at that district and then at MMSD, they pay for it anyway. They already have it, so I didn't have to fight that fight, but I really liked it for students that have attendance issues and being able as a way to introduce topics and to introduce concepts that I wouldn't be able to teach in a lab, so I'm not going to be able to mimic an entire population of squirrels and all this stuff like that and I can do it with this.

Educator (14:28):

I can do this embryo development piece in the physical science realm. I was doing it with atom builders and building the atoms and seeing how they react and electro negativity and stuff. That's just really hard to teach without college level material and I find it works really good for that. But before, what I was originally using it for was that for every physical lab or thing I was doing in the classroom, I would pair a gizmo with it as a grade recovery task for students with if they were incarcerated for a couple months and they come back, what did I miss? Okay, well let's start with these things or out on maternity leave for a couple of months and then come back. All instances that I've dealt with."

The largest part was, hold on one moment, my wife calling me, I'm just going to say it was buying a lot of the initial supplies to start this lab up was the biggest purchase that I did that was I think a seven to $8,000 purchase and it was split amongst, it was about $150 on Amazon and I think it ended up being 5,000 through Carolina Biological and about two and a half to three through Flinn. And that was a lot of me trying to figure out what equipment was just the most cost effective across it. We had to pay shipping on it regardless, it doesn't matter. There wasn't really that many discounts or anything that related to that. Most recently I purchased Nutrient Auger and Petri dish plates for a bacterial growing lab just because that's something I couldn't purchase too far in advance. So I tried to kind of buy those to order that was Carolina Biological that I got that stuff and then I'm going to have students making soap and physical science for a ification lab for a chemical reaction lab and that material I bought through Amazon, it was just easier than going to the grocery store.

I bought half the glassware from Flinn and half from Carolina just simply based on pricing. I, I believe I bought the buns and burners from Carolina and the tubes from Flinn because of price.

Reliably? They have the cheaper prices. That's why a majority of the order was from Carolina. They also, in my experience, they're kind of off the shelf labs of blood typing lab and the micro electrolysis kit that I actually just recently used from them, they have pretty decent teaching materials, materialism. I adapted the micro electrolysis thing to kind of fit what I wanted it to do, but if I had to print it and give it to the kids, write out the book and I had no time, it probably would've been pretty effective too. And I know their blood typing labs got a similar kit. I know they have their catalyst lab to show yeast respiration and stuff like that. That's a pretty good one that I've seen before. Usually their microscope slides come with some kind of a kit and some kind of resource involved with it too. Their resources in that end and their kits are usually better. So I've been talking more and more to new teachers now that I've been in for a decade and they probably would be what I'd recommend just for the money. You could use the resources out the gate, especially if you're new.

So for me in particular, I don't really think of anything because I'm more designing my labs to what it is and then buying the materials that I need from whatever vendor. And it doesn't really matter, but thinking of new teachers, it would be really nice to how Carolina has those pre-made labs and have some pre-made materials. That's good. I've also bought posters and they're like comes with worksheets and I looked at 'em and they're crap. But a decent lab, something that's written that's going to challenge the kids to make an argument based on this data that they're collecting and not just run a cookie cutter lab, something that's going to align automatically out the gate to the NG, putting it onto the package. Considering a lot of districts have gone to nng SS, that's kind of I think the more popular science one now. So start putting it on almost like on the box, this does HS LS two dash five and you're like, sweet, that's what I'm doing.

Educator (32:57):

And then you can just grab the thing and do it. I think that would be really useful. It just saves a little bit of the busy work with that. I also would like it if the materials were digitally available and it would be awesome if any materials that came with the stuff maybe have a download code and it wasn't just a PDF, it would be awesome if that was a Word document or a Google document, even if it's watermarked or something to prevent recopying and reposting on the internet and that that's illegal. It you, it's watermarked, right? I'm fine with that. It's just I use Google Classroom so much and if I have something in A PDF, I have to hand retype it unless I use that PDF transfer software and then I have to go and fix it anyway. And I've just gotten to the point where I just typed faster and do it that way. So I think would be really just saving little bits of time here and there just kind of cutting some of the waste."

Interviewer 1 (33:56):

And my assumption is you want it as a word or Google doc because you want to customize it or can you say a little bit more about why you want it that way?

Educator (34:07):

So words, word documents. I can convert to Google Docs and put on Google Classroom to be completed. Google Docs automatically do that. PDFs, they have to download Lumen. If it's a fillable PDF, I have to teach 'em how to use it. Half the times those don't save properly and most schools are switched to Chromebooks anyway, so they struggle with doing fillable PDFs on those Chromebooks, some of them."

Reliably? They have the cheaper prices. That's why a majority of the order was from Carolina. They also, in my experience, they're kind of off the shelf labs of blood typing lab and the micro electrolysis kit that I actually just recently used from them, they have pretty decent teaching materials, materialism. I adapted the micro electrolysis thing to kind of fit what I wanted it to do, but if I had to print it and give it to the kids, write out the book and I had no time, it probably would've been pretty effective too. And I know their blood typing labs got a similar kit. I know they have their catalyst lab to show yeast respiration and stuff like that. That's a pretty good one that I've seen before. Usually their microscope slides come with some kind of a kit and some kind of resource involved with it too. Their resources in that end and their kits are usually better. So I've been talking more and more to new teachers now that I've been in for a decade and they probably would be what I'd recommend just for the money. You could use the resources out the gate, especially if you're new.

Interviewer 1 (26:49):

Okay, so you can use the resources out just when you're new start. You mentioned that they were reliably lower priced and how is their reliability in general and what do you roll into that notion of reliability?

Educator (27:10):

The stuff that I get isn't broken and it works and it's cheaper than usually Fisher or Flinn or Thermo Fisher for sure. And so I just kind of gravitate to that. It doesn't have to, what was I trying to say here? I wouldn't say that with science supplies there's really not a quality difference. Like a Pyrex speaker is a Pyrex speaker for the most part. Some of are a little thicker and thinner, but for the most part their stuff's all reliable. I can do that and if I broke it, then I know that I could buy a replacement for slightly cheaper than the other place."

I wish there was a better, so I just recently did a fireworks flame test.

Interviewer 1 (34:57):

Oh yeah,

Educator (34:58):

Neat. Yeah, it's awesome. I love it. Love doing it with the kids and I wish that there was a better version of that. There's some that exist where they'll sell you the liquid or they'll sell you the powder to flame test and they ask you to like, oh, get an inoculating loop or a platinum wire or a stainless, because depending on the wire, it burns different colors and screws it up. And so what I did was I made solutions pretty high molar solutions of the salts, the metal salts and soaked them in coffee stirs until those got soaked full and then used those to light or soaked the coffee stir and dipped it into the salt itself and then light those into it because then I'm not having 'em deal with a hot metal thing that they have to quench and then those corrode really fast when you're burning salts on 'em.

Educator (35:57):

And so I wish there was something out the gate like that where you could just buy the set and almost like they do, I forget which company has it, but they have antibiotic test for bacteria and they'll sell you basically the Petri dish, the liquid to inoculate the entire Petri dish and then the antibiotics on discs that you just put onto it and then you can see the area and what's affected by that. But I don't have to soak those little cotton swabs and antibiotic either. They're already there. I wish they had something like that where it was just like, here, these sticks, it's enough for 10 groups of four and there's all the different colors and you just have 'em expose 'em to it and record down in this data rather than trying to deal with the chemicals. Some of 'em are toxic, it's a mess. It would be really nice to do it that way."

I don't know. I think just again, having, if there's, they're going to provide worksheets and stuff, have it in a format that's more usable, just the PDF to run off on the copier, that's not 21st century anymore. We're not just making copies of worksheets as much anymore. And I think that'd be nice as little setups steps as you can do would be nice. Not saying everything needs to go in a little dropper bottles right out the gate. You can big bottle of stuff and then I could put it in dropper bottles, that's fine too. But less mixing maybe would be nice in certain labs, especially ones where they might produce some kind of a fume. A lot of the new high schools aren't getting fume hoods. They set up my lab and they gave me bumps and burners and I don't have a fume hood and it's bizarre. I'm not a huge fan of it. I am fighting to get a flame blanket and so I have plenty of fire extinguishers, which is nice, and a safety shower and I wash stations, but just no fume hood. So I think fume hoods are starting to become a really big expense that's not being done as much

Okay. Do your standards-based grading, do they only test on the disciplinary core ideas in science or did they also test on cross-cutting concepts in science and engineering practices?

Educator (45:09):

In ours, the way we're doing it this year, and it's kind of different at a competency-based school, well competency I'm putting in air quotes, not truly a competency, but anyway, we have our competencies, which is our standards, and then we have four success criteria, almost kind of like a flexible rubric being like if they can show me that they know the characteristics of life, the parts that make up the cell these things, and I have 'em better written at school, then they get points towards showing proficiency in that standard, which is the competency which we're switching from showing competency in the success criteria to proficiency in the standard buzzword buzzword. So that's kind of what we're doing with it now. And MPS, when I was teaching standards-based grading there, it was showing three pieces of evidence that hit the standard within the disciplinary core ideas that you're teaching for that current unit that you're doing. So we kind of looked more at those. I know the Nng SS has a cells in its function and then there's multiple standards within that kind of umbrella. And that umbrella would be my unit and then all the standards under it that I choose to teach would be the standards that are hitting that unit, and then we'd move on to the next unit kind of thing was how it was developed there.

That's okay. Do you remember what kind of dissections you get or things you get to dissect from plan?

Educator (19:45):

My first year I think we tried the fetal pigs

Interviewer 1 (19:50):

And it was just such a mess that we kind of stopped doing that after my first year. And

Educator (19:57):

Then after that, the big one, the one that the kids liked the most was kind of the laced messy was the owl pellets. So owl pellets have the little bones of the rodents that they've eaten in them, and so the kids are able to pull those apart and see what's inside basically.

Interviewer 1 (20:14):

Yeah, we actually had a local guy the first two years that I worked here where he took our microscopes and refurbished. So he did that with our microscopes and our scales, our balances, and I believe we stayed within that a thousand dollars budget though because he was local, he was doing it kind of as a service to the school, but also he needed to pay for parts and pay for himself. I don't remember exactly the amounts that he charged, but I think we did stay within the science budget for that year.

We have a school account, so what I do is I would go on Amazon and put together a shopping card or a wishlist, and then I would take that to our finance person. Her name's Judy. She's fantastic. And she would then take that and order it through the school's account. I believe it is shared between the two schools. I could be mistaken. It might be just be one account or it might be two separate accounts.

Interviewer 1 (23:36):

Okay. Did those orders happen at the twice a year as well, or are they all year long?

Educator (23:42):

Those are, again, just pretty much twice a year. If there's something that I absolutely need and I forgot about it, I would be able to squeeze in an order, but we try to keep 'em to two a year.

Not currently. I know the state's trying to move a little bit more toward that, but excuse me there kind of the closest we get to that is on the test.

For my classes, we actually use an online learning management system. The Canvas is the one that we use. So for days that we just have assignments that's posted online, so if they miss class, everything, the notes and everything, my presentation is posted online for them to make that up. If they miss a lab day, that gets a little bit trickier because typically we want to do that altogether. And I'm a little hesitant to send lab kits home with students because I know they're not going to make it home. They're not going to make it back to me, I guess is the thing. For example, we did a bonding lab where they have little dots that connect together that represent oxygen and hydrogen, and if they just miss that day, I would have to either have them work through it without the kit or find a time when I can work with them in lab, maybe after school or during lunch and they could actually get the manipulative part of that done.

There are a few that would be helpful. There was one that I kind of had to come up with on my own. It was a mining kit where they went through with different tools and found out the cost associated with mining. And it was really interesting because they were able to bring in budgeting and mining that we had talked about in class, but they were also able to take in, we put fines on the different messes that they made during the mining process. So if they made too much of a mess, they got a fine, but they noticed that if they mined enough of the mineral that we were looking for, the fine was basically not even there. So a bunch of the kids just ended up dumping the bucket out and paying the little fine because they ended up with all the material,

If there's something, if there's a kit we want that's not on the list, we can write it in as a supplemental purchase and then we turn the list of supplies over to our instructional leader. They input it into some database somewhere. It scans through and finds the lowest contracted bid kind of thing. And then if it's not exactly what we want, if there's something of a comparable price or a slightly more affordable price that's a comparable item. We'll end up getting that.

What it is, what unit it goes with. It goes in our storage room. When time comes to need it, you go get it, you take it back to your room, do what you got to do. If there's anything left over, it goes into a special location as if it's something that's not perishable, we keep it.

Three little packs of microscope slides in it and all this air bubble wrap around it just oversizing the packaging for a small thing or throwing chemicals with glassware with paper products in one box and not really sure what's in the box until you go digging through it. But as far as the kids themselves, a couple of times you've had kids come where things were broken through, probably rough handling somewhere along the supply chain, but other than that, nothing really wrong with the kit themselves, just the way we get them sometimes, the way they're packaged with other things.

As things come in, we do have a folder for all the MSDS papers. There is a central file in our storage room where we have to catalog in the kit and what chemicals are in it, and then a location of where it's being stored. If chemicals come in separately, like for the chemistry labs that are not part of a kit, but they order something in a large quantity, we do have a folder where all it gets written down and where it's located and when teachers need to use it, they have to sign out their names, the date, the quantity they're taking, when they return it, if there's anything they return or if there's none returned, it's been all used up, that kind of thing. We do have the proper storage cabinets, the flammable cabinets that are metal. We've got the wooden ones for the acids and whatnot, whatnot other. So we do have, it took a little while, but we finally got that worked out and running smoothly over the last two years I would say.

Interviewer 1 (19:58):

Until you open the shrink wrap and open the box. You're not sure exactly what's in it.

Educator (20:03):

If there was a paper put in with it or something, so you didn't have to open up the shrink wrap and say, in this kit you have X, Y, Z chemicals and the storage codes for them, that would be very helpful. I know most of the kits, the chemicals are in such small quantities and I guess harmless concentrations, for lack of a better word there

Interviewer 1 (20:26):

That

Educator (20:26):

They can stay together in the kit and just be put somewhere. But again, it would be nice to have something on the outside of the box or a set of paper we could put on the cabinet with those kits to say, this kit has this in it, this kit has this in it, so we'd know exactly where.

For me, being a visual person, a picture of what is inside the box on the cover of it, a lot of the boxes from Carolina, they're white with some blue lettering. It says Carolina Biological, and there's a sticker on one end that just has the product number and the name of what the lab is. In the past, we have gotten from other vendors where the top of the box has a picture of it set up on a lab table so you can see what's in the box without having to open the box kind of thing.

From what I've seen, the vendors are pretty good with having in the very front of both the student booklet or the student handouts and the teacher one, the safety code indicators as far as whether you need goggles, gloves, apron, which as an acid, make sure you have an acid spill set, clean up, whatnot.

We have 42 minute class periods

(26:20):

For the sciences. We meet six periods a week, so we have four days of a single period, one day of a double period for doing lab activities. Next year that's going to possibly change to more of a block schedule because the problem now is if you're doing something, your lab day doesn't always fall. When you are ready to do a lab for a topic, you may have a lab on Monday and then have to introduce it on Tuesday and explain this because the way the schedule is set up next year it'll be more organic. Hey, we can do a lab tomorrow, let's do it because we'll have the time. That kind of thing. We have a 42 minutes students come in, we have a little do now activity, introduce a topic, have the students work on something, have an exit activity at the end and off they go.

Interviewer 1 (27:07):

How often do you do labs?

Educator (27:09):

Right now, like I said, it's normally once a week when we have a double period, unless there's something that can be done in a 42 minute class period or let's real like 35 minutes as a demo or a short little activity, then we do 'em more often if possible. There's a lot of projects and research-based things that go on where the students are given a topic and you tell them, because we have very fortunate to have a one-to-one Chromebook student ratio. So I can give 'em a topic and say in 30 minutes, here's four questions, give me some information, go do it, come back the whole thing. They can design their own labs too, sometimes have 'em more later on in the year, once they're more used to it, give 'em a one day period to design a lab that they could then do on the lab day that goes with the topic we're covering."

Well, let's see, a few, many years ago they bought a bunch of veneer probes but never bought the equipment to hook 'em up to. So we have probes that can go nowhere. Now. Let's see what else. We have the usual microscopes, both regular light microscopes and dissecting microscopes. Every room has an incubator slash oven in it if needed. Glassware, we got lots of glassware, beakers, flask, graduated cylinders, test tubes, and then whatever comes in the kits that we can keep that UCF year after year, there's syringes from one. We'll keep those. If there's little well plates for mixing things, we'll keep those. That's pretty much it. Like I said, mostly glassware. The microscopes pretty much what everyone has in their rooms.

Interviewer 1 (29:09):

And then if something breaks and that kind of thing, do you keep a list and pass it on or how do you do that?

Educator (29:16):

When glassware breaks, we keep a record of it and we've got such a backup in our storage room that you can just replace it with no problem. As of right now, as far as the microscopes, if something happens to one of them, they have to find the guy who knows how to fix 'em"

And

Educator (29:33):

Here go fix it. Because when I started they had an outside vendor would come in once a year to tune up everything and one day I just watched what he did and I can do this as needed. I said it to the wrong person like, oh, you can do as needed. Well guess what?

Interviewer 1 (29:47):

Here's another thing to add to your resume.

Educator (29:50):

But I don't mind. I've fixed a lot of the microscopes. If it's something that I can do easily or if there's two that are broken but they're broken differently, cannibalizing into one that works kind of thing, as they got older, we'd replace 'em. If things are out of my scope of being able to fix, there is still a vendor they have that can come in and twice a year they can bring 'em in and he can work on whatever needs to be majorly done. Like I said, with the glassware, we try to keep a record of if something breaks and just we have, like I said, a big supply of extras to pull from.

There's another set, I don't recall who makes it, but they are thick like craft foam pieces to do DNA replication and protein synthesis where you put it together and it's a large kit. I mean the pieces are probably for the nucleotides almost two inches long and they go together like a zipper and you pull it actually through the ribosome that separates it. We can then put in the transfer RNA and whatnot. I forget who makes those. I know I found that someone had posted a video of them online probably eight or nine years ago and I showed it to my supervisor when I was teaching AP bio at the time and he looked at it, well that's kind of cool. How many do you want? I said, could I have like six? So he ordered eight from separate vendor.

Were using those and I used those for years. And then when I stopped teaching AP bio, I gave it to the next teacher who's doing it and she's been using 'em now for a few years.

I don't dunno if a vendor could really do much. I know it would be nice if every so often an administrator was required to come in and teach a class for a month, walk in our shoes kind of thing. I know where I am. A lot of the administrators are very bogged down with discipline issues and paperwork and family this and policy that and blah, blah blah. Where some of the kids don't even know who the vice principals are. They never see 'em. They're just hiding in their office. They're handling all these other little things. But then if something goes wrong in the classroom, the administrators are not aware of what's happening in the school. So they don't know what led up to it and what could have maybe prevented or headed off this possible conflict until it gets to the point where now it's a really big deal that shouldn't have been. Some of the best administrators I've had over the years are ones who made sure they walked to the hallways every day. They would stop in a classroom just, hi, how you doing? Can I get you anything? Say hello to the students, greet 'em in the hallways. The administrators who hid in their office and came out only when something bad happened and it was a different feel.

Yeah, I have to breathe on that one. Yeah. Okay. Well I want to be respectful of your time. So we really, here's my wrap up question then, and also if you have anything that you just want to say, but okay, so our client in this particular case and other clients that we work for, large vendors, our large companies, would you like to tell 'em, or if you had a wishlist or that's really two different questions, but what would you like to see you thought, man, that would be cool.

But the rest of it not so much. So could you maybe break it up into you can buy the whole kit or just buy the component that you want to use?

(41:39):

I'm sure they do have teacher input in some way, shape or form when creating these things. I don't know how that works, but definitely ask teachers, what activity would you like to do for this topic and what would that look like? And maybe try to go with that as far as designing something new that would be better. Maybe try to differentiate things a little more for the socioeconomic background of places. Because where I teach, it's considering an inner city type of school district. It's got a high poverty rate. A lot of students on the free reduced launch program, reading levels are not where they should be. They're lower. So we get a kit that's meant for a junior biology class, but the students are not reading really well at that level. So I have to take time to break it down for them.

Even if it's the same kit, the same activity, but have two or three different student versions of how it's written up and presented to the student. Have one that's meant for a lower reader that maybe doesn't do all of the components, but does the key ones then have one that's maybe more for the honors student who can read at grade level, who can handle a little more and do the basic parts and then go with the next step with it.

Interviewer 1 (07:17):

Yeah. How many people do you usually have in a lab group then?

Educator (07:22):

Well, it depends on what lab we're doing. I sometimes like the groups of four, which works out perfectly with 16, so four groups of four, but it really depends on what class and what lab. A lot of times with the advanced class, the AP students, I'll just have the students work in pairs, so it's nice. Everyone definitely gets to have experiences with the lab equipment and understanding the concepts processes.

Interviewer 1 (07:53):

That's great. Well, I'm just going to walk through a couple of the basics. I was just thinking about how your school might be different from some of the other ones that we talked to, so that's a really good, helpful background. Oh, one more question.

So it was just spot on in terms of it gave the kids a visual. It was simple. I appreciated the fact that you mentioned what do teachers need? Things are busy, everybody's busy. So I was very appreciative of the fact that the experts of who designed and made the AL gbs, that company came up with all the background information and they had a handout for us as teachers to show us, because I didn't make connections to the Carbonate cycle. So they provided us with resources, with background, and then they actually had a lesson plan, so it was kind of ready to go. And then the answer key was very appreciative too. I mean, just because you're busy, it's not a matter of, you can't figure it out. It's a matter of you just simply don't have time. You know what I mean? It's just a different world.

Well, right now in a new position, I would like my lab completely organized so I know exactly what I have because I'm feeling a little bit like, oh, I don't know where everything is today. There was all of these little foam tongue depressors. They look like tongue depressors, but they're foam. And I was so excited to find that box because I'm like, I can introduce chromosomes with them and write with a magic marker, make alleles on them letters. So I was so excited to find them, but it literally took me an hour to organize them because it was all chaotic. So right now, my magic wand is probably not telling you information that you want, but I would love to have my lab organized so I could tell you, okay, yes, I would like this, this, and this. In terms of supply my problem, I don't know exactly what all my supplies are until I think I go through the whole year.

Educator (41:01):

I won't be able to tell you exactly what kind of supply I need. I'm very, very lab-based, so that would be maybe my magic wand wish that keep things affordable so I can keep buying the hands-on in the lab supplies for my students because they really appreciate. I do a survey with the kids. He always asks, how do you want to learn? What could I do as your teacher to make learning fun and better for you?

I haven't seen any URLs that would be helpful and some things are missing. And that's been where I go to Google then, and I'm trying to like, okay, the name of the company, I was very frustrated. I couldn't find any student directions for, it was a cell membrane kit that I found that I absolutely loved, and it had the proteins embed it and I found it, but then I couldn't find any student interactions for a while. So it is very helpful when there's keys. Some of the kits are molecular model kits, and I might just not have had time to find them yet. They might be somewhere in the lab, but they'll use, okay, red for oxygen, white for hydrogen, and it's very helpful if I have a key. So I haven't found that key. There was an amino acid folding kit that had a key that was amazing. That might've been a 3D molecular design, but it was great and it was even laminated. So I don't know if the vendor laminated that and sent it with the kit or if that was something the previous teacher found. The key of this amino acid is hydrophobic. This amino acid is hydrophilic. These are non-polar polar, and it's a beautiful one page simple color coded and laminated. So keys are definitely helpful for the kits.

Whole interest is still looking for, I mean, you said how to serve science educators better and support materials. That was what I think I wrote down, right?

Interviewer 1 (49:50):

Yeah. In general, that's all the research that we focus on. Sometimes it may have a very narrow bent to it. It may be that we're just talking to, we have a client that came to us that is physics in college, and so that's our focus. Or in this case it was life sciences. So in general, catapult X represents clients who are wanting to get teacher feedback, and that's what we really specialize is specifically in Science and STEM. And we only work with clients who provide incentives because we think it's important to make sure that teachers are valued as professionals. We only work with the Science and STEM community, and we really only work with organizations that are looking at it from the perspective of how do we make science education better for teachers? How do we make it better for students? So that's kind of how, as an organization, we've narrowed our focus because those are values that both Kim and I have and everybody that in Catapult that contributes has those values as well. So that's what we focus on.

And they love coming in the room because of course when we did the speed dating organelles, I had to go all out and I put the candles, I brought in mints. So any lab we do, of course I am a little OCD, I take it to that level.

Well, that is the million dollar question, right? Because none of us in any of our classes just grab a lab or a kit and say, oh, pop, we're going to do this. Maybe in the genetics class they might do a PFA lab, which of course is fun and cool and it all has to do with the flexibility with framing how the students come to the understanding of the content. So because we're really trying to get kids to construct their understanding, it requires very deliberate reveal or sequence of how you teach that. And oftentimes because we have kids creating their own projects, sometimes we want them to try to struggle through the procedure part or sometimes we want them to give them a procedure and say, okay, now change a different variable and do this. So the flexibility to kind of determine where we're going to have the kids do the work and where we're going to do the work is what, I just did this literally yesterday.

And I think that's true and I often think like, okay, so if someone came and said, laid this out, would you use it the way it is? I don't know if I ever would because I'd be, I don't know. I think that's part of being an independent school. I have the ability and the funds and the resources to be able to change those things. I only have the maximum number of kids I have in a class is 18, so I'm not worried about class management stuff. So I think we're pretty unique. I'm not sure we're going to, talking to me is going to be very helpful because we are pretty unique I think across a lot of variables. But if I were to think about what that would mean is having the kit, but being able to have three ways to present it to your kids. You could present it this way, you could present it this way, you can present it this way depending on what your needs are or the levels of the kids, that is differentiation. But it could also be just how you're presenting the materials to the kids too."

We feel like those are just as important as the academic stuff or figuring out how to balance that is also important skill. So the reduction in homework is coming from parents, from kids, teachers. I don't want kids sleeping in my class. I'd rather have you not do homework and pay attention to my class where the learning is happening. And that's where we're discussing it. I can see that you're incorporating that because if they're too sleepy in class, I can't really know where they're in their learning. But if they're engaging my class, I'd be like, oh, he gets it. She doesn't, I can move on or I cannot move on. I can adjust my class basically. But if I get a lump, I don't know what the lump knows and doesn't know

I don't know a single teacher who didn't think, what else could I do to make a living at some point during covid or shortly thereafter, I think at our school, I think C coincided with a big shift in the culture and the curriculum, the ous things that were happening in the curriculum. So some folks who had been here for 25 years or went to school here and then worked here for 20 years didn't agree with what was happening and how it was happening. And so they chose to go elsewhere. So that push started with the hiring of me and someone else who was hired at the same time, who's the other chemistry teacher. And then I think that just happened to be at the same time covid happened. And so I think Covid might've accelerated some of that.

Educator (38:18):

So we actually have working for us now a teacher who quit teaching physics. He taught physics in public schools for 30 years and quit and worked at a nursery nearby, like a plant nursery. And he just happened to be neighbor of our lab technician who lives here, who replaced someone who retired because they'd worked here like 35 years and just was time for them to retire. And he had had enough post covid. He was like, I can't do this. I'm going to do what every teacher I know had done. I'm just going to go work at the nursery and be with plants all day.

He's come back and he loves it because he's like, this is amazing. This is dreamy compared to what he's used to. He has a big budget, he has small classes, he's loving it.

Educator (40:59):

Because a lot of stuff you can set it up a lab and do it right, but we want them to show them that acceleration due gravity is constant, right? But if they screw up the lab, they might get an acceleration due to gravity of minus 12 meters per second square and it'll be off and they're like, it's not right. And getting these concrete thinkers in ninth grade to really think like, well is 12 that bad if I look? So somehow striking the balance between doing real science and asking real questions and still knowing that works and that we do get answers that are, I feel like I started teaching 20 some years ago and I always started with a lot of content hammer. We're learning content content and I think all I've done is take content out and just focus on process and skills and things like that. And I don't know where the balance is, but I would love in five or 10 years to feel like I know where that balance between content and skills and real science and kind of, I dunno, padded, I don't want to say padded, not artificial, but you know what I mean. The data we collect in real life is never perfect.

Interviewer 1 (42:20):

Yep, that's true.

Educator (42:21):

And so when you have kids do relapse to try to uncover a topic or something, you want them to get good enough data that they see the pattern or what you're trying to reveal the relationship between those two variables. But you also don't want it to be so perfect that it's an algorithm from a computer lab,

Interviewer 1 (42:38):

Which

Educator (42:38):

Is some of the problems with online stimulation labs. It's not really because give you the perfect, perfect line or whatever. And we know that isn't what happens.

Educator (42:55):

And we know this because we've collected, this is also our problem. The kids think they'd have five trials and they have the answer and it's like, well, not five trials isn't going to do it. So in terms of life science, what I would like to see is real science being done or kids being able to take something that they learn, stimulate it digitally and do it a version of it in real life. If we think about ecology or those things I like here, we really try to use our campus, so the kids are doing ed NA projects of the stuff that there is on campus.

He's worked with a lot of folks, but real scientists who are in the field collect data and his kids do the work to try and do those things, identify things. So our primary school teacher, science teacher, to the best of her ability tried to get kids to think about contributing to some of the bird studies, native versus non-native birds that are in our forest or in our wetlands or whatever. So the merging of science and science in real life would be amazing. That would be cool. Where kids could really see that I have a long-term vision of the kids on our campus starting in pre-K or whatever, and doing projects on campus that they would see over their course of 18 years here or 13 years here.

I want to go back to packaging for a minute. So less plastics, is that in shipping and packaging or is it in the product overall? And does it bug you that the sensors are made out of plastic or the, I mean, what would you most like to see reduced?

Educator (45:55):

Well, packaging is always something I'd like to see reduced, but I think it's, especially in biology labs, it's just the non reusable plastic tips and plastic pipettes and what was I using the other day? The plastic was awful. Oh, I'm in room where the light shut off automatically.

Interviewer 1 (46:20):

Sorry. No problem.

Educator (46:22):

I got to move around. I think that non reusable, non-recyclable sort of plastic waste that comes, the probes are plastic. That's true. I just feel like, especially at our school, there's just a lot of waste and it's the waste. It's just the stuff that isn't, I don't mind it. If I use the Vernier probe for 15 years, it's fine, but if I use this thing once and I'm going to throw it away, it's just like,

College. I went to a women's college, Douglas College of Rutgers University in New Jersey. Then I transferred to another college that was sort of women oriented, but then it was more convenient for me to, because my major was changing for my master's. So I graduated from Temple University with secondary education specifically in the sciences. From there, I continued on with postgraduate credits, but couldn't decide where I'd like to, what direction I wanted to go into. Everything at that point in my life seemed interesting and I'm taking courses and courses and I just felt like I'm not really headed in one particular direction. So my doctor just sort of got put on hold until I would figure out what I wanted to do. Then my husband and I said, Hey, it's time to start a family. So I'm working for the school district. I worked for an alternative school. It was a 12 month school right before the school district, and the woman whose position I was taking said, I asked why she was leaving. You always want to know why someone's leaving. Am I missing something? And she said, I'm going to go with the school district of Philadelphia. And I said, oh, hmm. She goes, you should apply. Okay. 

Educator (07:48):

So I guess I started the process, and this is an alternative program, a 12 month program for the students who are expelled or kicked out of the school district for behavioral issues. It was one science, one math, one social studies, one English, one of those, and they counseling during the day and they had their breakfast and lunch in the program.

What year was it? 

Educator (08:18):

Wow, so that must have been around 1983. I, yeah, I want to say I graduated in 81, did my master's 82 finished it. I guess I did year round to finish early. So I'd say probably 83 is when I did this alternative program. It was 12 months and then 18 months later I got my position, the school district, which was perfect timing because we received a notice that they didn't know how long their funding would last, 

Educator (09:04):

And it was a very interesting situation to be in. I'm a young kid at the time and I just assumed I would keep teaching, right. I grew up in a family that valued family education and volunteering. So I just thought, well, I'll just teach. And a woman older than myself who was married to a minister said to me, she realized that I had planned on continuing and she pulled me to the side and privately said, Barbara, if there's no funding, that means you're not getting paid. I said, I realized that. And she goes, and you're not going to work. And I said, my jaw dropped. And I said, I was very honest with her. I said, I'm surprised to hear you say that your minister's wife. I just sort of assumed we give and we give and we give. And she said, yeah, you're right. I am, but you have to draw the line. And"

They've changed it tremendously because they want that course to support biology to get the kids ready for the keystone. So they put in topics, of course it's science and you can fit it into environmental science because we're talking about the living environment. But they'll spend a lot more time on things that are real that you would normally just do in the biology classroom. And then they'll go back to those topics again in the spring and teachers are looking, we'll talk about it. What are you going to do now that you haven't already done?

We don't need microscopes. It's not even part of the curriculum. It's one of those things that you just embed in your lesson. And so some teachers will spend a day on it, some will spend a day and a half, but it's not in curriculum per se, as it used to be 20 years ago. So she said, we really don't need microscopes. I wish someone would've reached out to me. I am the science chair, and we have a wishlist.

They, there was no comment. So How

As 

Educator (41:27):

Stated, you don't want things piecemealed. You get this box this week and a month later, you're getting something else. We don't want substitutes. If we've chosen something, that's what we would expect to get. We would expect that instructions would be there, that it would be a high quality material because the kids are touching things, because in science, you want them to be curious and active participants, so you don't want it to easily break. So we want it to be high quality, dependable. You want it to have a customer service number that you can call. You want them to have a department that even you questions about how to use it, that someone can answer your questions. Oftentimes you'll hear, oh, well try the video. So I think we're looking for all the support that a teacher can get to use the material and use it so that it enhances learning for our students.

So just so you know, our school district uses a portfolio model for purchasing. So a lot of the purchasing is left up at the school level. So we're budgets and they do their own purchasing. So a lot of what happens within that. So there's tiers of purchasing, there's district level purchasing, so for example, textbooks that would be at the district level. And then in terms of keeping up with labs and lab supplies or programming that is around specific themes for a school. We have two schools of health and medicine, so they have a slightly different theme. So there's that. And so what often happens is they come to me for recommendations. What is it that we're trying to get this program up and running? What's the basic materials that we're going to need? Can you give us some recommendations for vendors? Safety things? Every once in a while we're doing a special project and we could use some support around, again, purchasing to the point where a school had gone down to the wire and through some kind of funding they had, I think it was $60,000 to spend on science equipment and basically we had to spend in 48 hours or they were going to lose that funding."

Well, so I got on the phone, I called the teachers because to me it's very, very important to get the actual instructor's input instead of me just randomly saying, this is what you're going to need. They were able to join me on teams on a Sunday night, and I said, we opted to go through a vendor school specialty, which is a one-stop shop for us, so that we didn't have to look at a lot of different vendors because we knew we had to go. It wasn't necessarily shopping for the best price, but that's what we were doing.

Educator (08:46):

And so that's what we did, and we went through class by class, item by item, what it was that they were looking for. So we looked at general equipment. Again, life science are going to need microscopes and slides and glassware, and I didn't put on that. We looked at probes, but they did for pH and things. So a lot of my most recent purchases that would be for life science also, it's hard for me to tease that out from the general science equipment that we're doing. Right. So some specific things like that. And then of course we look at things like for the life sciences, some of the kit based programs that are there around genetics, things that we can get that are models, life science models. One teacher was really interested in getting some of the cross section of a flower, those traditional cross section of the cell models.

Educator (09:54):

So I've had, I've had several schools that have started anatomy and physiology programs, and so we've had everything from the one school that was very much a little bit more traditional, and they needed a skeleton and dissection materials because they were doing some survey things to a program that was three years in the making, which is doing virtual with ocular devices. So we had to purchase laptops that had high resolution to be able to do the 3D imaging, and that's in partnership with the Cleveland Clinic.

Educator (21:20):

And they have that all under their umbrella. Another group that we, I'm going to say within the last several years, we did a large scale purchase through was STEM Scopes. And again, really excellent program in terms of kit based science for you have the lessons, you have the plans. It was in alignment with our literacy goals and our math goals. And then you had all the supplies that you needed to run the lab experiment that they had. Teachers did not have to go out, and there's always that you have to go purchase a celery or something like that.

The other thing is too, through Carolina, we've gone away from doing dissection. Ohio does not have dissection as part of their biology standards anymore.

Honestly, I mean first and foremost is usually price. So going to look at price, they're going to look at what kind of services being provided. So is shipping included in that price? Is shipping additional, are they only able to ship to a central location or can they ship to the individual schools? Shipping to individual schools puts you up in a different bracket. And then usually when I'm working with those vendors, I work on what kind of training and professional development is included in this bundled pricing that we're getting. And so for example, the last textbook type purchase I negotiated so that we had at least three years of professional development that was available because we get new teachers in, teachers switch subjects.

Educator (33:40):

So I needed to be able to redo the come see McGraw Hill 1 0 1 again to the teacher maybe in that third year saying, now here we are. You've had two years to get used to this product. Now we're going to take a deep dive into how you can really pump up your teaching experience. So to me, that's really important. Again, some of that relationship between the sales reps and the vendors is also very, very important. So like you said, usually I get it down to top three, break it down to top, maybe top two, and then price point. But then it is that customer service experience."

My colleague, because we were able to bundle science and social studies together, more purchase power kept saying we still need to do a traditional paper textbook.

Yeah. So to most of who I've been working with are doing the asynchronous learning series. So the teachers can do that. So most of them are offering that. I'm actually wishing that more of them would go back to doing some of the in-person. But one of the vendors that I worked with when we were transitioning to that digital work, I asked if they would be willing to do small cohorts of students, that we could have student ambassadors, and they were willing to come in and work with students rather than just the teachers. So what we were able to do was on a professional development, I was able to pull teachers out of the classroom. The teachers came, they were allowed to select between three and five students to be their student ambassadors. The teachers went and did the teacher training, and we took the students in and we demoed everything from the student lens about how they would submit their homework and how they would do all of that kind of stuff. And what that did is hold the teachers more accountable to actually using the digital materials,

Educator (39:32):

But it also sets those students up as leaders and to be able to be role models. And so it takes some pressure off of the teacher because you can go to another student and say, how do I do this?

Educator (39:46):

That's easier.

Educator (39:47):

That is really smart.

Educator (39:51):

That was the goal. We were laughing. I said there was always that kid, I just remember when I was first teaching that could thread the film through the projector when you got stuck. So this is just at a different level now. We've got that kid that's there that a little tech savvy and says, here, this is how you send this as an attachment. This is how you download this.

So many vendors, they focus on the teacher at the teacher level. So I would love to see things that they offer at the student level and then in the other direction. A lot of times we have the building leadership and the principals, they also would like to see things, but they need to see it through their lens. They're not necessarily a practitioner, but they need to know when they're walking into that life science classroom what it is that they should be observing.

When I walk teachers through the lab, we'll do a bit of a modified lab, but they actually go through it as if they're the students so that they see all of it. Principals don't need an hour, hour and a half dive like that. They need a 15 minute overview of if you're coming in and Kirsten is using this genetics kit, what you should see is student groups working with these materials to do build this. This is what you should see when you're going in. If you're going into the anatomy and physiology class, the virtual physiology, you may see a lot of kids with goggles just waving their hands around and what is it that they're doing. But then too, the flip side of it is that in terms of when they're making their budgeting decisions need to do some ooh off for those principals so that when a science teacher comes in all excited about it, that the principal can say, oh, was that the 3D heart that was beating right now? Okay, I'm willing to budget for that. Or I saw that really awesome genetics kit where the kids were building their puppies or whatever it was that they were doing.

Educator (43:09):

That's really interesting. Now, did they ever need, probably not for the walkthrough, but did the principals or the district level people, do you ever need something that talks about how the materials are based on research-based learning practices or efficacy studies, or are those things useful?"

But in terms of the day-to-day walkthrough, not so much. So along with that portfolio piece, and the reason that they call the teachers will call me, but principals will too, is that kind of menu of options. So the idea is that we've done that research for them and here's maybe the top five choices that we can give them. Okay. Or if they come to me with something maybe I'm not familiar with, because there's so much out there that I can then go and do that legwork for them so that that's not on their plate. And I can say, okay, so I've done this research, I called Cincinnati, Akron, Toledo because I heard that they were using the programs and this is what their folks are saying, that kind of stuff.

So when they're showing their data and everything, they're going to come across and say, students who used our biology program showed a 30% increase in proficiency on state exams or whatever. But then I might then call Akron and they said, well, yeah, they did. But what they failed to tell you was we had to purchase additional materials in order to make the program work. They provided the core, but we didn't realize we were going to have to do this. Or they give you some of those insights maybe that the vendor's not going to necessarily tell you.

It goes back to that customer service piece, and right now, currently a lot of things are those AI chats or those robotic chats. People want to connect to a live human and usually pretty quickly when they run into trouble. So to be able to call the customer, help tech support and talk to somebody fairly quickly and to be able to jump on something like Zoom or teams where they can screen share to see what the problem is, I think that that's key. What I would like is cut me out as the middleman, because what often happens is the teacher contacts me with the issue, then I have to contact the vendor. I would like them to be able to directly feel comfortable enough connecting with the vendor so that that issue gets resolved. And instead of it taking 48 hours to up to a couple of weeks to make those connections because obviously then that is loss of learning for those students.

So more things where maybe you do a large scale purchase for the equipment piece of it. And then for the consumables, there is a way that you can set up a subscription like Amazon does, where you can say, oh, I want this delivered every two months or whatever. To be able to do that either. Because part of the problem is too, with consumables, particularly there's a lack of space and storage in the schools.

Pretty Much every teacher, there are a few that are funded differently. The Title one teachers, some of them get a card, some of them don't, and I'm not sure how that all works. I know we have a science teacher who is only part-time, so she does not get a card, but almost all full-time teachers get a card. Now as a science teacher, there are also some other funds that we can tap into. I'm not technically in charge of those funds. I submit a wishlist to the principal in the final days of school after the kids have gone home and we get what we can with however much money we have left and my wishlist is put together with the other two teachers and somebody else is making the decisions on what actually gets purchased at that.

I'm the Flynn Scientific. At some point in my career, there was a school that said you need to do some specific science training, and at the time Flynn had their lab safety video series and so I watched that and that was where I got my science training hours. And so I started using them and they had a great customer rep who when I submitted an order, she added the shipping and it was over my amount of money, so she went in and fixed it so that I was never charged shipping.

I'm the Flynn Scientific. At some point in my career, there was a school that said you need to do some specific science training, and at the time Flynn had their lab safety video series and so I watched that and that was where I got my science training hours. And so I started using them and they had a great customer rep who when I submitted an order, she added the shipping and it was over my amount of money, so she went in and fixed it so that I was never charged shipping. She fixed it so that the tax free status automatically popped up that that was never an issue. She had some extra stuff and she sent me a magnetic stirring hot plate.

And so when I moved in, there was stuff that had been purchased in the 1940s. I mean there was tons of stuff that needed to be gotten rid of and Flynn was the company who had all of those things online and I could print 'em out and organize it and I could present it to my principal and my school board and say, look, we've got to get rid of this stuff. And eventually I put my hands on radioactive material that had been purchased in the fifties and we were able to get somebody from EPA to come in and help us take care of that kind of stuff.

But in terms of as a beta club sponsor, there are things that I used to do that I no longer want to do because I've got to get a PO and if it's over a certain amount, then I've got to get a second quote and I don't necessarily know where to go to get that second quote. Same thing happened with textbooks. They told me they'd get me new textbooks, but I had to get a quote and I literally could not get a sales rep from anywhere to call me back. And the person in charge of purchasing finally told me that if I would just go print something out showing how much Amazon was going to charge for the same product, that could count as my quote. I know a couple of years ago we were blessed, we had enough money and we were allowed to get 12 new microscopes and today after that scandal, we would've had to have second quotes and third quotes, and if a sales rep has an ability to pull that together for us, that might make a difference for somebody. They are talking about refurbishing my lab, which I mean, as I said, my parents went to school in the room I teach in.

We do the one where you grow the yeast and you have the balloon on top of it to measure how much carbon dioxide's given off where you kill it with the heating it up and you kill it with pH. And then how does temperature affect it? How does pH affect it? We do some in photosynthesis and cell respiration. Of course, we don't do the mouse part of the cell respiration, but we have cell respiration. Ones that involve yeast and which looks very similar to the enzyme one, but we go at it from a slightly different aspect.

Any kind of online program that will lock down the hard drive so that the kids can't cheat by just going and Googling it because that's huge. We were giving our nine weeks test and I stopped 10 out of 130 kids from Googling answers on there because I didn't have a way to stop them.

They've done becoming a millionaire from YouTube, social media, whether they're 80, can't see in one eye, but I'm raising my grandchildren or my great-grandchildren. So who speaks to them? We've got all of these scenarios 

Interviewer 1 (15:54):

And what does that look like? So what does it look like that you are communicating or involving the parents and is it even possible? 

Educator (16:07):

Well, I think it is, but I think we're going to have to take more of a direct approach. The answer I got from the state was, well, we have resources online. And I'm like, you missed it. You missed it. That's not our day-to-day. You missed it. We are having a whole communication breakdown, a whole generational breakdown, a whole different parent. We've got expectations and they've got expectations. I need a liaison to be in the gap. And that's what we were putting in there. We were like, we want a specialist. I'm recommending that actually for every school. And I will just speak for our state that there's before you, just to answer some of your questions, just to help you navigate some of the nuances before. Because what we're getting now is contention, anger. We're getting, I mean you knew, I don't know if you know this, when they changed the laws about what we're teaching kids about sexuality and how that's all coming to boards and everything, but that anger started because of the communication piece. 

Educator (17:07):

When parents trust the school district and they have a good communication, you didn't see it become that volatile. I mean, it was legit volatile. They were threatening teachers, staff, you're not teaching my kids that, whatever, because I don't trust you. I don't know you because you don't know me. And so that's where we're getting more and more of that and that empowered people. They call us, cuss us out. Student gets in trouble. You know what, I'm going to just text my mom. You know what? I'm coming up there to get you. I'm just coming up there to get you. I don't even want to deal with it. The significant amount of people that, because they're dealing with discipline issues that are now pulling their kids out to homeschool 'em and aren't really doing it, but I'm sick of the school calling me. Well, maybe there was somebody in the gap there that can talk to you for real, not show you data, not just offer an IEP. 

Educator (17:51):

What is going on? I told my teachers, I said, now when you do parent conferences, it used to be you have to show you care about the kids, but now you got to show you care about the parent. How are you Ms. Long? How are you making? Well, I had surgery. You can't skip that and say, Johnny's failing because she's going to shut down. Everybody's in their affective domain and their emotions and their feelings, and I'm like, you've got to be that person. If you're going to survive talking to parents now because they're going to want to know you care about them, then their child now, we'll see about getting that work.

When parents trust the school district and they have a good communication, you didn't see it become that volatile. I mean, it was legit volatile. They were threatening teachers, staff, you're not teaching my kids that, whatever, because I don't trust you. I don't know you because you don't know me. And so that's where we're getting more and more of that and that empowered people. They call us, cuss us out. Student gets in trouble. You know what, I'm going to just text my mom. You know what?

What is going on? I told my teachers, I said, now when you do parent conferences, it used to be you have to show you care about the kids, but now you got to show you care about the parent. How are you Ms. Long? How are you making? Well, I had surgery. You can't skip that and say, Johnny's failing because she's going to shut down. Everybody's in their affective domain and their emotions and their feelings, and I'm like, you've got to be that person. If you're going to survive talking to parents now because they're going to want to know you care about them, then their child now, we'll see about getting that work.

Now in your coursework, you're not going to master all of those. And she's a special ed teacher, which most of the time they're generalists when we get them. So she's had to learn all of that and then people that go into the class. So we need a variety of resources that allows for that. And we've been able to find some, but it was hard for at first, she was kind of creating her own, and then we were digging and digging and digging and trying to find some things that would support her being able to do that. But yeah, sometimes there are people in secondary level, they are specialists. They know exactly where they want to go, but they're being challenged now because of literacy levels kids are coming in with, it's like, I don't know what to do here. They are not really with me still. I'm speaking about science and I'm going and they're looking. And so we've had to backtrack, make sure everybody got textbooks.

There's no, I've not heard. I hate science where I was growing up because it was like read the text and answer the questions and every now and then you might have a film or whatever, or we might go outside and look at the clouds. They get to see it, they get to touch it, they get to. So anything like that, they love that. And the other thing is I think it speaks to more kids. It's hands on. It's like, ah. 

Educator (34:02):

It is very exciting for all of our kids. So in those sciences, in the middle school, our kids do well, again, we're trying to really push more. I'm using the literacy. They have textbooks, they have the digital pieces and everything like that. And so nurturing that gets them ready for the high school where we do have, they start off with environmental science and then biology, they go into whatever. We have chemistry, we have physics. We try to keep it as exciting as possible. Another thing that we are working on are field trips. We're trying to bring back more. We're close to Philadelphia. They just actually took a trip where the kids saw surgery, I think. 

Educator (34:44):

Yeah, yeah. I just met with the science department, the high school science department. And I'm like, listen, let's get out. Let's let them see. Because that's going to help them determine a career path too. It can't just be so you guys are great, but let's get them out into the world to see these sciences in action. Let's go to the beach and look and dig up some ditches. And so we we're doing a lot of that work. So yeah, but our kids, they actually talk about it.

They don't do the ordering through me, but a lot of 'em are catalog companies. This year we got stereo microscopes for one of the class, we had a grant and they were really expensive, but this was some isolated vendor where she found a good price for them. So they look, they search, but for all their materials, a lot of times they're just catalog companies that we keep using. I think it's just two or three major ones.

Some of the vendors that I get all my science techs from, that's Sava. So they're not just science. So I work with them with other companies, but I will say they're not calling me about science. They're not making that specific where they have a person. So a big company, having a person that's like their key science person. I see you're ordering a lot of science materials. I see your state has changed your standards in science. What can we do? What can I show you? I got to reach out to them. Okay. Can you give me a crosswalk for the standards? Not specific. Unless I pay for pd. And then that's just one and done. So if they want that to really come alive, just like having that key, once it triggers your ordering science materials. If it's a big company, then there's a person who again, becomes a part of our staff and helping us develop, helping us when the standards change, helping stay on top, just being with us in the journey. That would be great. And when I work with companies like that, we stay with them. We grow. We get a relationship with them and we trust them. Now you're not just calling me, hi, I am. I just want to talk to you about this company. I'm deleting that. I'm sorry, I am busy. But now I get a call from Daylene. I'm like, oh, hey, well, I just want, Hey, time, just checking in.

Carrying capacity like maximum ecosystem can support what causes populations to rise and fall, predator parade relationships, resource management.

So there's a lot of graphing involved with that and I think that's a big topic for the ecology portion of our course for Bio A is this idea of carrying capacity building models, representing that which is not good for students, a not of graphing, and what does that graph mean? So I'd say that's a big topic. I'm not really finding anything very useful for, we try to do energy movement through ecosystems like food webs. And I know my roommate, we have an A m PMM session, so I have a roommate, he teaches environmental science, so he does a little bit of that as well.

I would say so, but I think again, a lot of our kids, it's all over the place. It's attendance, it's motivation. Some of 'em lower reading level, lower English proficiency, some of 'em have a lot of gaps in their education where we're teaching high school material, but I sometimes have to drop back to sixth and seventh grade standards. Sometimes I just, because where they're at and attendance and whatnot. But I think just something very accessible where they feel they could do it and kind of build that confidence as well is often an issue. And I would say for me, I'm, I don't say difficult as a teacher, but I think I set the bar a little bit higher than some of my other colleagues here, which is almost giving credits away I want to say, which I kind of hate. I want my kids to leave here with something valuable as opposed to I just passed a class, you actually got something, learn something, gain something, but something accessible and something that maybe they, and you get that from every kid in every classroom. Why do I need to learn this? What's the point of this?

I got a hydroponics garden started, tried it again. The student buy-in probably might've been my problem or I didn't give 'em enough chance to buy-in. So I kind of want to get into more, not just the hydroponics but the hydroponics with the goldfish and the fish cycling the nutrients and materials a little bit more just to kind of show that it does tie into what we teach carbon cycling. But no, we have the worms here now. But no, we really haven't dealt with live specimens per se. Something I'm open to and thinking about a little bit more. Even something like, oh, a little class pet, I just don't want to take care of it. I bought a litter robot for the fiance. I don't want to do anything with glitters. Aren't feeding nothing.

Where you have an essential question and then kids design an experiment and collect data and ideally that's what we want our kids to get. That's a skill we want myself and my colleagues in the science department. But these kids struggle with that independent idea. The independent, they want a right answer to just point to it and give it to me as opposed to there is no right answer. What does that data mean to you? I forgot what top brought this up. But that's the number one skill I want these kids to have. Collect data, provide the evidence, back up the evidence. What does that data mean? That's ideal. But a kid that gives the kids some background knowledge, maybe here's a way to collect data, here's a way to express that data. Now what does this mean?

Okay. So you really trying to teach them how to think critically and not just know the facts, but how to understand giving them a framework to understand the world

And the application of the world. And

Educator (33:34):

Again, interpreting data. Again, our school's trying to focus on mental emotional health a lot, but also just those transferable skills. And I fail to recognize even as a teacher sometimes that when I'm teaching these kids, they unfortunately aren't going to do anything with when they leave here. And besides maybe just, oh, I remember learning that as opposed to, Hey, is there a skill they can take with us if they don't go to college, they don't go to school. Hey, you need to learn how to interpret data. You need to know how to be curious about why something. So I think that's the number one thing is, I don't know

Interviewer 1 (34:20):

When you were talking about that, I don't have a question so much as a comment and then I'll come back. But they might surprise you in how they end up using those things because even when you vote, you need to be able to understand claim evidence and reasoning to make a decision as to whether or not that data is valid. So it becomes just, or when you go to the doctor and they make a recommendation and you have to decide whether or not you get a second one. So I only bring that up because you said you weren't sure if they're ever going to use it, but I think that

Cheapest and the quickest that we could actually more reliable. And I say the best win for us with regards to supplying it. I had one, for example, for my sea urchins. We were going to go with a small company here in Florida, but they wanted, and I wanted just a small half dozen batch of sea urchins because I figured Florida warm weather, how hard it could be. It's just up the street from us. We can just, how cheap can they possibly just deliver it to us? And it seemed okay. The price wise was $88 for the sea urchins. I was like, great, that's perfectly fine. But then shipping was another 300 bucks. They wanted to tack on that, and I was going, how come it's so expensive? I mean, literally you are at best two hours away by car. I mean, literally I could just drive over and pick it up and come back and they're like, well, we don't do things that way.

I normally talk to the teachers and I try to figure out what is it that they need, and I also try to see what we're missing from previous years, what we used up and what has. Over the summer, I went through all the labs and I kind of did a quick inventory to see what we were missing and glassware was missing and was cracked, and some of it was broken, stuff like that. And we had to order new dissection kits, so we needed to get new scalpels and forceps and probes and stuff like that, because I wanted to do the dissection lab, but I wanted to have, you can't dissect if you don't have the tools.

Educator (12:22):

And a lot of it came up as, I would say, probably a month prior to the lab or the specific activity, they would come to me and say, I have to sign off on all their purchase orders. So they would bring 'em to me and say, I need this because I want to do this lab in a month and a half, but I don't have X, Y, or Z and I'm missing this. So they would come to me and say, okay.

That's interesting. So they don't end up there over the weekend or something like that.

Well, actually the sticky notes here in the catalog is because it was the rock signs. Originally, my environmental teacher was looking at Amazon

Educator (20:50):

To purchase the kit from, and I looked at the kit and it was $88 for one set, and he needed three sets to complete the lab for his students, and I got this catalog. I just got the sheep organs behind me. So I was flipping through here and I said, do you need, how many do you need? He was like, well, I need 12 rocks and I have to have this and I need to have a nail so that I could scrape through. And I was like, okay, fine. So I started flipping through this catalog and it has a really neatly broken down by colors, different sections and stuff like that. So I sticky noted and gave it to him and said, here, check it out. You can actually get for the same price that we're getting three, we can actually get 10 for your class if you need that many so you don't have to kind of cut corners and you can have more of a more diverse setup for your lab. He came back to me this afternoon, he says, actually, this will work really great. It'll be cheaper and we can get six. So he goes, I want six instead of three with the other group. So I was like, okay. Okay.

Interviewer 1 (22:06):

And you mentioned the sheep organs. Did you get the sheep organs from Nassco and that's where the catalog came in or, yes. Okay. All right. That sounds good.

You get the balance of the two right there.

Those are the big three that float around in my mind whenever I'm looking for something. And worst case scenario, if I'm really pressed for time and it's something that the teacher really needs, then we'll punt and go with Amazon.

We have an Amazon card that we get certain discount points. I don't know, I'm not quite sure how that works out, but I let them know that we can only get certain things from Amazon and they'll go ahead and order it for us, but they'll put it on their Amazon credit corporate card.

Interviewer 1 (28:44):

Okay. And did those happen one time a year with Amazon or did they happen throughout the year?

Educator (28:50):

This case, it actually happened just once a year. Really it's, it's a freak thing. Normally it's like we can't get it from the initial vendor, so we end up having to punt and go ahead and get it from Amazon instead because it's just, we can get prime shipping. So we get it overnighted to us and it resolves. One of the issues I came up with was that they didn't have chloroform for one of the chemistry labs they were doing and they needed some pheno and they weren't able to get it from the normal vendor of Flynn, so they ended up having to get it from Amazon. Amazon was able to give it to us the next day. So it just worked out everything else we would get from them. Huh,

Interviewer 1 (29:49):

Okay. Do you have a preference for the companies that specialize in life sciences or is it really, I'm just trying to get a sense there. You said that you go to Carolina for everything, living and nassco for everything that's not living. How did you make that distinction?

It's always funny when you're talking about the life sciences and you have to talk about the living and the dead and what you need. And there's also, yeah, it's always interesting to me. Let me see.

I like the fact that let's say Carolina and Flynn and that they give us the labs already in a nutshell. And I mean they actually give us the actual handouts that come with the lab. The actual will be like they give you a teacher version with all the instructions and everything like that and what to look out for and they give you one for the students. So all you really need to do is just make a copy of it and give it to the student and say, okay, this is your lab, go ahead and go to it.

And a lot of them come into class going, my last class was so boring, I can't wait till you go to your class. And that's the difference. That's how we get them intrigued and actually engaged in there.

Just can't be simply talking and lecturing and saying, okay, here's a periodic table, I'm going blow something up. Really honestly, make a chemical reaction onto there. This year the kids go from biology to chemistry and they come to me for anatomy and physiology. So I explained to 'em, it's like you might think that chemistry is a foregone object in your life. I know how much you were looking forward to it, but guess what chemistry is going to be with you in this class as well too. And I showed them some basic reactions and stuff where hydrogen gas was released from the combination of product and chemicals and we set that on fire. So it was beautiful. Nice blue, magenta flame.

Educator (07:35):

The year's been actually pretty good and literally we had everybody's okay, but there was a house fire right in the middle of town that blocked one of the buses for making it an on-campus and then the road was closed for a period of time, so not only did it impact that bus, but two other buses that were leaving the district. So we had about a hundred kids at our elementary school for about an hour and a half until we could get 'em back on the bus and then once the road was opened up. So that doesn't happen very often for us, but we dealt with it and that's kind of one of those welcome to the superintendency"

I think it's fair to say within the past year in terms of budgetary processes and then purchasing and things like that. I'll start literally, we have inservice dad Monday in our district, and I don't know if you need the demographics or not, but we're a small rural school district, north central Pennsylvania, about 900 students, two buildings pre-K to six building and then a seven to 12 building. Very rural, very rural and high levels of poverty. We've got about 60, 61% of our kids have pre and reduced lunches. But I would say with regards to sciences in terms of traditional processes, we begin our budget processes in January. We share that with the board of directors beginning in March. We do a preliminary budget that the board approves in May, and then we do a final budget in June. With regards to the sciences in particular, it was not an atypical budget cycle, meaning our traditional year over year purchases could be supplemental curriculum, could be textbooks generally, although we worked in a cycle this year, but we do buy supplies for physics, for chemistry, everything from balances to chemicals to things like that.

Educator (11:49):

And so that is a fairly normalized cycle at our high school, at our elementary school because science, although it's tested in fourth grade in Pennsylvania, and again I don't know where you guys are from, but there is a fourth grade PSSA test that they give, which literally accounts for nothing. It's just a test that they have the kids take. Science has not been necessarily a standalone subject for us at an elementary level. A lot of those items are incorporated into ELA blocks and things like that. So I would say with regards to that, we are a fairly normalized type district in terms of processes. So some curriculum supplies, things like that for our labs and what have you. So a pretty normalized cycle, especially post covid."

The last big purchase, I guess would be twofold. We have standalone STEM labs that we purchased both for the high school and the elementary school. So these are traditional classrooms. We worked with a company out of Colorado and the last big one was probably about six years ago at the elementary school. We had a STEM lab that we purchased.

Educator (14:48):

And then what we've done as well is there's a curriculum piece. It's about $10,000 a year, so the various activities and whatnot that the kids will do. But what we were able to do is we used some of our ER's money and we front loaded, if you will, I think we did a five year curriculum purchase so we got a better price, what have you. But in terms of dollar figures, both of those labs were between a hundred and $150,000. Great group to work with you literally you provide them the space, they do the design and they come in and they install all of your desks, your labs, your functioning robotics kits, all of your interactive activities. They do that in a weeks' period of time in the summer and then they do the teacher training on the backside. So it's been something surprising that's actually pretty common for our rural part of Pennsylvania. Several of our schools have done the same thing.

Educator (15:56):

And they're out of Colorado and probably I've been superintendent portal Gini for 10 years. It was probably eight, nine years ago. They were working with a school in Pittsburgh and then a school in Bradford, which is about an hour west of us and all the small schools talk. And when we were able to see what they did at Bradford, we visited there and we felt that this was a great investment with our kids. So we had a high school STEM lab that was put in place, I guess it was about seven years ago and then it was about five years ago we did worked with the same company and did our elementary lab.

Interviewer 1 (16:37):

Within the Commonwealth there are intermediate units, so they're like subsets of the state. So in our region, our intermediate unit is nine and there's 14 school districts and they literally range from the smallest school district in Pennsylvania is Austin. They have about 170 kids to 12. The largest is Bradford. I think they have about 2200 kids, but tomorrow we have a meeting, it's called the Superintendent's Advisory Council. So we get together with the executive director of the IU once a month. We do that about six months out of the year. Usually we don't meet in the summer and it's just kind of freewheeling collaboration, what's working not we find out because we're not heavily laden with administration just because we're so small, I think it's vitally important to get a lot of your ideas or to bounce things off of your colleagues. And we are, as a collective group, we're really, really close just even personally because we go through the same struggles as small rural schools from staffing to what have you. And I think when something is shared by a school district, and I mean that's probably more valuable than a sales rep or even folks from the state because we all know that we're in the same kind of demographic, the same operational thing. But that's what we do. We're we're very close collectively.

Educator (18:35):

Well, we do have a CTC where the kids can travel, but this would be all distance learning. So you would almost in this capacity, whether it's a zoom call or things like that, we actually did a collaborative two years ago with Austin, that small school district in the state where about 30 miles apart. So they had their kids taking French in a real time capacity as we piped it in to their kids. But the fact that 14 schools aren't going to be able to find however many chemistry teachers they need, whether that's 15, 20 depending on the size of the school total, but schools are going to be forced to do a lot of that remotely. There's no doubt in my mind.

Interviewer 1 (24:02):

So let's take chemistry because that's what you've been talking about and let's say that a bunch of the districts in the commonwealth go together and they form a chemistry collaborative where students can take classes and it's online chemistry is a very hands-on subject.

Number one, Pennsylvania is going to have to look at some of the restrictions that are placed upon schools. I don't think there's any question that that's going to happen, but I think number two, knowing that many of the teachers that will be coming into education are non-traditional, meaning maybe they come from business or they come from whatever background. I think the more things that vendors can do to make them hands-on and user-friendly is going to be incredibly valuable because you're not going to be able to rely on the expertise of this person because number one, they haven't necessarily been trained per se, they just have a college degree and the more things that textbook companies or vendors or what have you, the more things that they can do to assist in the course and materials and supplementals, everything that will be probably more important than it ever has been simply because the staffing issue

Interviewer 1 (26:44):

That makes a lot of sense. The problem that we're trying to solve there then is really having things ready to go for a teacher who may or may not have a lot of background in that subject but has to meet science standards and do the hands-on. So are you guys using digital? Are you having hands-on kits sent home to students? How does that work then? What's best? Well,"

I think if a school district or a group of schools were to buy that as a group, that makes it a heck of a lot easier. And again, I'm not a science guy per se, but if I'm going over balancing equations and there's some type of lab tied to that, oh by the way, we're going to use lab kit 6.4, get it out and away we go, that's going to make it a heck of a lot easier than trying to figure all that out is maybe a group of four or five school districts.

Interviewer 1 (29:03):

And so what you're thinking is that with those kits, if you're buying as a collaborative, you've got more purchasing power because you're buying for a group and you can share is what I'm kind of hearing

Educator (29:15):

And honestly, I don't know how important cost becomes if you have no other options. Again, I'm an old economics guy, so it's kind of supply and demand. Look, if you have no other options and if that means you have to pay a premium for these kits because of that, I think you pay the premium. And so this isn't, at least in our situation or in my opinion with the small schools, this isn't necessarily driven by economics, it's just the state of nature in public education and if you have to pay an extra 50% or something for your materials, so be it because if you do it the traditional way and you don't have traditional people working in that capacity, it is I think you're headed for disaster."

Think best practices, again, knowing full well, and again, I think this trend has only continued knowing full well that most of your teachers hired within the state that I live, they're not emergency cer, so they don't have your traditional methods classes and ed psych and all of those things. But I think a vendor partnership or collaboration, whether it's maybe something like this, access to what would be considered a master teacher or somebody who is maybe taught in a distance capacity or something like that, the more things that vendors can do to assist in that bridge, if you will, to get that uncertified person to the point where they're competent within the classroom, they're comfortable in the classroom. I think there's great value in that as well. Probably even more so than a regular curriculum setting because a lot of times if you have a teacher that's 20, 25 years in the business and you have a new math curriculum or whatever at the high school, this just in, they're probably going to figure it out. They probably don't need a lot of the PD that maybe is offered, but if you've got somebody who's been working in marketing for 10 years but likes working with kids, the PD is a greater value for somebody like that.

We always enjoy going to Colorado Springs, so there's a place we go there. What's really nice, it's a three day conference. It is kind of laid back. There's a handful of vendors, but I really, really enjoy talking to superintendents from Iowa, Montana, Colorado, Alaska, California, and some of them are large, some of them are small. I tend to go to see some of the smaller districts, but I remember a gentleman who was from Idaho, I think I spoke with him last year, and they're in an agricultural area.

Educator (32:52):

They've had four day school for 20 years. It's just kind of accepted in the community. It helps out with the families that are running the farms and whatnot, and I really enjoy some of those conversations. I remember Nebraska, Nebraska has done, again, very rural state overall, has really done a lot of things with regards to distance learning, whatever that's been in play there for a number of years. But yeah, it's nice to meet some of those folks.

Yeah, I think if the conversation is driven on the district end, this districts know what their needs are. Maybe they have curriculum cycles where they look at certain subject areas like every five years or what have you. That's probably better than I've been in this 32 years. I've been a superintendent for 13. I don't know if I ever actively pursued a product or curriculum or software where I was contacted, whereas a vendor says, Hey, we have an X for you. And I dunno where I'm cynical or whatnot, but if I have a need within the district or if I have a conversation with one of my colleagues about something that they've had success with, you know what, yeah, I'll reach out and have that conversation.

No, it's okay. We basically go through a curriculum adoption or at least having the discussion of adopting new textbooks about every five years in the district. Other than that, I personally in my own classroom try to use some Vernier technology, so I've purchased some of that. It's not use as much as I would like to because we're pretty, our department has been forced to basically teach in teams. So what I teach everybody else is sort of teaching. So I'm required to basically teach the many of the same lessons and I have to give the same assessments, summative informative assessments, so I don't have as much independence in my classroom as I used to, what I can and can't do, I guess, which is positive in some ways, but also negative in some ways.

Yeah, probably, I mean for live specimens like LOD for some photosynthesis labs, cellular respiration kind of labs. Yeah, probably just basic chemicals. We'll go through Carolina. Usually every year we're ordering some consumables. Well, the things that might just last a couple of years, like some modeling like DNA models that you kind of have to replace just because of things getting broken or lost. Those are probably the big things. The Vernier things I usually order directly from Earner, and again, we've kind of moved away from using that technology a little bit just because it wasn't really embraced by my science department.

So I don't personally order very often from there, but usually what we say is usually we just have a list of things that supplies and materials that when chemistry does their annual or semi-annual orders, then we'll just tag along with them.

So wet labs, I mean since probably even before Covid in our biology department, we were not doing dissections at the high school level here. Dissections occur only in the anatomy physiology curriculum. So they usually are doing fetal pigs or cats sometimes. 

Educator (20:51):

And honestly, I don't know who they order from now back in prior to Covid and our junior high department, which is in a separate building and is not really on the same, I don't know. They used to do just kind of a general dissection, the worms and the grasshoppers, and they used to do that, but I don't believe they're doing those anymore. Life science in our district only is occurring in fifth and sixth grade, and then it's not happening again until 10th grade. So I don't think they're doing dissections in seventh or eighth grade either.

If I'm hearing you correctly, you basically say, Hey, I need this and this and this, and they either go, is it your science department chair? Yeah, 

Educator (26:03):

So we write purchase orders, our science department chair person or head signs off on it, and it goes off to our central office, and it has to be approved at that level as well. And it's pretty easy to get approval for smaller items like under $250, but over that it has to go, actually, now it has to be approved by our school board.

I mean, obviously pretty important. I know our teacher, the teachers in our department and the anatomy physiology courses, she was very worried about being able to get specimens. I think that's probably their expensive items. She was worried that they were not going to get those in time for actually doing the dissections when they're actually supposed to.

Absolutely. Yeah. And I'm not anti-technology, just lots of teachers, but until we and the science people and the companies kind of develop a way to either integrate the phone into how we are teaching it, then you're going to see more and more schools. One of the biggest districts here in Nebraska at the high school level, well pretty much K 12 has just banned cell phones from the classroom. Our school board is probably moving towards that as well, where just the cell phones are just, they're either stuck up on the teacher's door or they're just not in the classroom at all, which I don't know, is that really the right answer? I mean, kids, the phones are just really great tools for figuring things out and finding information and collaborating and all of that. But also, it's really hard for teachers to compete with TikTok and games and social media and just kids wanting to interact with their friends that aren't in the classroom. 

Interviewer 1 (32:56):

Yeah, that makes sense. 

Educator (32:58):

So yeah, I mean, I think we need to find ways to make it more authentic, which isn't easy and it's not cheap, but we're finding that if our kids are building models, even if they're just building a simple DNA model out of beads and pipe cleaners, they just don't have the tactile skills to build things. So how are they going to go out into the workforce and manipulate real life things if they can't, even if they haven't had any practice with doing things, Things."

Absolutely. I'm a past president of the Nebraska. We have a science teachers association here in Nebraska, which when I got really engaged in coaching, I kind of didn't have time for anymore. But I'm still a strong proponent of that association. And if you're ever needing to connect with a larger group of teachers in Nebraska that is a really good organization that reaches out, they can reach out statewide to lots of other teachers, more diverse teachers than myself.

Quite the lively class. That's nice of you. So as far as animals go, I have no live animals in my classroom right now, and there's a reason behind this. So the reason behind this is they shut the power off constantly in the evening and on the weekends here. So I would have to take the animals back and forth in addition to the fact that our school isn't so fond of people bringing animals anymore. We actually had a situation quite a few years ago where we had a teacher bring an animal into school that was not very controlled, brought a dog in school that I think maybe became aggressive with a couple of the students and they kind of frowned upon that right now. But I used to have a lot, I used to have fish and amphibians. I used to have a pet snake there in the classroom and all those things, but I'm, I'm not in my own classroom right now, unfortunately. I'm sure you can see there's French behind me, not biology, but I unfortunately don't have them in my classroom anymore. I used to have a lot, but

Interviewer 1 (10:41):

That's too bad. Is that sad to hear stories, but I totally understand with the electricity, especially going out out, I worked with a company that had a large saline fish tank and literally we had to go out and buy its own generator for it so that if the electricity went off, the fish were still alive. So

Educator (11:07):

I was taking the fish eventually from school to my home every single night and weekend and it became the most unbearable, unbearable task in the entire world. So in addition to a biology teacher, I'm also one of the student council advisors here, and we are really, really, we're a very big, very active student council and it got to the point where it just became impossible."

It's been a long time. So I'm sure you, based on what you're telling me, you probably found the article in the PO record from a while ago, right? Is that correct? So that was once again with the amount of time you have to make some choices what you do here. So I used to be the environmental club advisor and I was really highly involved in that. And just to give you a little bit of background on our district, it all used to be one school, high school and district. And what happened was 21 years ago, so this was actually a while ago that I was environmental club 21 years ago, the school split because our population became really large and when the school split, they kind of looked for people to take on some responsibilities they didn't have at the time. So I was doing real well with Environmental Club, I continued to do it here.

Educator (12:33):

And so the other student council advisors, my wife as well, and I was also, you know who the boss is, it's not me. So I was also helping out with student council a lot. And once again, it got to the point where there was only so much time in the day and I felt like we all have things that are challenges for us that bring out the best in us and that interest us. And it got to the point with student council, that and environmental club is very satisfying as well, but just how passionate and active our student council are here really, really pulled me in. And when it got to the point where it was like, okay, I have a committee meeting for student council every single day except for Monday, once every other week. It was no longer fair the environmental but that.

Educator (13:27):

So basically what happened is half of them joined student council anyway, came over with me, our better ones, and we have some other teachers here who had interest in doing the environmental club stuff. So I kind of passed it on to other people and they took the job and they split it amongst a couple of them, one of the club aspects of it and the other one took the enon aspects of it. So time constraints led to that, but I think I know where you got the idea of all these things Back way back, I won an award for conservation. I later the year, I'm sure it was in the poker record, the article with me holding up the little samples and living things, looking a lot younger, a whole lot younger than I do right now, which is nice. So I'm glad you saw that article if you saw the picture. Yeah, but that was, I used to do that unfortunately. Once again, like I said, I love Environmental Club.

Educator (17:11):

So school budget, our school, what we do is we do budget. We basically just did it every October for the next school year right now. So we're actually really early compared to what we used to be When we budget, we budget for the classes, the schedule that we currently teach and it's assumed that if your schedule teaching that right now that applies. So basically the way that we do it is there are some materials that get budgeted that go into a bid process, general classroom wise, colored pencils, markers, things like that, things that are science specific. I usually have the ability to order through non-bid sources using one of our biological suppliers, whether it's ward order a lot from right now, a lot of what we use in class, what's critical, more easy to find on their site, easy to order. We've ordered from other places. Obviously

Interviewer 1 (18:25):

You're cutting out just a little bit. So I did, I'm sorry. That's okay. You said you primarily buy from wards, but you also buy from other

Suppliers. Yeah, so depending on the year we might buy from other suppliers as well and what they have at the time pretty much. Can you hear me?

Interviewer 1 (18:42):

Yeah, I can hear you.

Educator (18:43):

Okay. Yeah, I'm sorry. So like I said, we kind of search, so we ordered so early, we don't have catalogs yet from the company, so everything is through the online catalogs right now. So if there's something that we want to implement that we don't have awards, I'm going to go to one of the other sites, whether it's Fishers or Fisher or any of them and pretty much work for it. And when I find the one that I like, I'm usually able order it.

Okay. A couple of questions. When you said you set your budget in October for the next school year, do you mean, so this October in 2023, were you setting it for the 20 24 25 school

Educator (19:30):

Year? That's correct. That's correct. So what the district does is the district has us request all of our supplies and request all of our needs for class because what they want is, and we have a large district, so it's a lot of work for 'em, is they want to make sure that before the end of the year, before the end of the calendar year, and I don't understand all the way the way because all the way why they do that because it wasn't the same a few years ago. They want it budgeted by the end of the calendar year for financial purposes, which is why they have us do our budget in October, not for the new calendar year, but right now we just did it for the 2020 4.5 school year.

Interviewer 1 (20:13):

That makes sense. I think that always confuses a lot of people too. They're like, why would they do that? But there are several schools that do their budgets the way you just described.

Educator (20:34):

Not necessarily. What generally goes to bid are just common classroom supplies most of the time. So we do have department chairs and it was a little bit this year, so this year our department chair sent us a spreadsheet of what we considered was mostly the common supplies that people ordered and we just put the numbers in and then she'll send it out for bid. So on bid it's general classroom supplies. In addition to that, there was also a science bid sheet for things that are common glassware, certain chemicals, ethyl alcohol and hydrogen peroxide and things that are, some of the stains that we use would go on bid. So I think what she did is she looked at our past few years and anything she saw, she was getting a number of orders for every single year it went on.

So what are the last kinds of things that you as a teacher said, okay, I need these things from my classroom, and how did you determine what you needed?

Educator (21:48):

So I determined what I needed based on our curriculum, based on what we teach. So right now I'm teaching two different levels of biology, honors biology and academic biology. And I also teach zoology electives right now. In addition, sometimes I teach anatomy and physiology elective. It just depends on the year. They'll give me whatever fits in that year and I'm good with all of it. So zoology, a lot of the supplies are consumable, a lot of dissection samples, a lot of preserved samples. What I found last year is that, so the zoology class, I usually have it and for a couple years it went to another teacher because they were loading me up with biology because my kids score pretty well in the state test and they needed to move the school forward a little bit more at the time. So it was the replacement of a lot of just preserved samples that we ordered back in the year 2001 or something like that, that essentially prepared slides that we use biology wise.

Educator (22:53):

There are things that we use that are the general lab activities that you're going to do in most biology classes. So the osmosis, the supplies that needed to continue to carry out gel, electrophoresis, those things, replay microscope that we replace every once in a while I need to worn out. And what I try to do then is I always try to sneak in one or two things. That's kind of a new thing that I'm looking forward to using. And sometimes I get those things, other times I don't get those things. It just depends on the year

Educator (24:30):

So I ended up searching for a new vendor this year because one of the products I use changed a lot, so I always use Wards. Wards actually produced a kit where instead of being actual DNA samples, it was the simulated DNA samples. So one of the reasons I always did that is our supplies generally come in in the summer and there's not always somebody here to refrigerator freeze the samples that come in right away. So I was working with that for a while. So last year that kind of ended a little bit and it went to the actual DNA samples, which is also great if things go well. They came in the summer, they didn't get refrigerated and when I did gel electrophoresis, we actually got no results because the DNA was denatured pretty much I was able to locate from somebody else some remaining supplies from the former samples that we had. And once again, we did that and worked perfectly though sometimes just based on the logistics of the building and who's receiving it, when it's being stored, when it's being received, sometimes there's products that just work a little bit better because door and it's not going to be.

Interviewer 1 (25:50):

Educator (25:57):

I have to look. That was in October. I did that, but I believe I would actually probably have to look and let you know that, but it was a vendor that deals very specifically more with it a genetic technology. I know it wasn't Odin, they don't really let you do the Odin stuff here all the time, even though I'd like to order some of theirs. But it was another supply company, they just not as much, trying to think of who it was, but it might've been Fisher, not quite as many options as Wards had a lot of times, but had some things that they're continuing to offer that Wards doesn't really offer I'm pretty sure was bigger.

Interviewer 1 (26:50):

Okay. And then you mentioned things like beakers and chemicals and that kind of stuff. Do you remember who you typically buy those through?

Educator (27:00):

So once again, when they're non-bid, they go through whatever biological supply company. So Wards seems like they've had the best prices on those last bunch of years, which is when I'm to, when you have a class that requires dissection, samples are real expensive and when you order your other samples, they're going to make you up money somewhere. So what I look for is where they're less expensive or if I need beakers, I'll order four per year for four years I have what I need, but they've been coming from wards when I do a non-bid because wards is usually usually the best price plan.

Once again, the issue for us right now is we're doing our budget in October and we're not getting the new paper catalog until January, February, maybe something or maybe the end of the year.

Whereas in the catalog, for example, with I know with Fisher and awards and catalogs, section glassware, these three pages beakers with a chart on it that says exactly this beaker made of this material in this measurement size, and for one, this is the cost next to it for a pack of 12, here's the cost. It's just really easy to use.

Interviewer 1 (31:52):

Okay. Is there anything with a catalog that you use to, I've seen somebody, people who've dogeared the pages or use sticky notes or little flags. How do you go through a catalog when you get it?

Educator (32:07):

That's exactly how I go through a catalog. So I go to the sections that I know, the first thing I do is I go to the sections that I know I absolutely need to order first and they're going to get sticky noted or dogeared and I know to go back to that. Then what I do is I start to look for things that are interesting that I haven't ordered before. And so I might find something with the skulls in it or some of those products and if I think it's something that I can use in a way that's engaging in class, it's active. Many times I'm at the very least going to order if it's a kit rather than get three of 'em right away when I know I would need three for my classes, I might get one and get it in one year first and get everything out and make sure it looks good, and then the next year order the other two so I can use them, use 'em with all the classes."

Interviewer 1 (33:01):

Not necessarily. So I think what I'm loyal to isn't necessarily the vendor, it's the service that you get from the vendor. So when you find the vendor that's giving you probably the prices that your school will spend money on and they're going to get you things that are on time and with quality, the quality that you're going to be able to use in class regardless of whether it's Wards, Fisher, Fisher, Flynn, that experience is going to be what creates multiple use.

I have. So I will no longer be ordering Elodia from Wards. I ordered two really large packages of Elodia and when they come from wards they come all ground. Whereas when I go on Amazon and I order 'em from Carolina's shop myself, they come in wonderful conditions. So Carolina really has become my go-to sample

Interviewer 1 (34:49):

We've all had some experiences with things that don't work when you, of course the day you go to do a class, the virtual transpiration lab, I was just talking to one of my colleagues about this, it works fine all the time. The day you go to do it in class, it's no longer working. So we're always searching for like that. They used to be offered all the time through McGraw Hill and McGraw Hill no longer once, I guess, and I'm not a computer programmer, but once was it Flash or whatever, was no longer, no longer working. A lot of those disappeared and that was an emergency for everybody. Some of the resources transferred over to HTML five, but not all of 'em. And some of those resources go effective. So I would say access to things that are both hands-on in person as well as access to things that are more virtual or online or even game oriented. That to me, that would make such an impression on me and be so usable. So usable in the classroom with the variety that you get with every kid with a, I think that would directly up for work right now.

Interviewer 1 (39:33):

Once again, that's actually, it's great that you brought that up because that's what we're doing right now. So we're doing bioenergetics. So hands-on lab wise, we use right now what I use is I use the photosynthesis respiration activity that's in two parts and I like to vary activities a lot. I believe students need to be active, a very hands-on, very minds on type of teacher. Along with that, the resource that I use right now for interactive with photosynthesis, respirations actually excellent is the bio site that has games and virtual labs on it. So I dunno if you're familiar with that, but the bio site is, yeah, the bio site is excellent and his interactives, his little games is playing video games for the kids, his interactives with photosynthesis and respiration. There's no way you can't learn what it's taking in and letting out things like that just because win the game, you have to do that and the kids get so obsessed with winning the game, then you go back and you talk to 'em about, okay, so tell me, what did you have to do to get out of the mitochondrial matrix?

Educator (41:05):

Oh, we had to go through that pump, that a TP synthase pump when it turned and let us out. Okay. So what is that showing you in real life? What were you playing? Oh, I was this hydrogen ion and okay, so look at this. What did you just learn and oh, I see what I just did now I know I did that. So they worked together just really, really well. So many kids with so many different learning styles. You can't successfully be a teacher anymore that we had in high school where it was lecture all the time and things like that. That's not how things work anymore. It's got to be experienced, experienced hands-on experience where the experiences lead the lead into the learn lesson, not the other way around where the learn lesson is."

It's skill development, and I preach this to kids all the time. I ask them on an everyday basis, what's more important? Memorizing a list of 10 words or knowing how to do something, the answer is always very clear. It's knowing how to do something. So when you develop basic skills, whether it's technology, whether it's hands-on experimental procedures, experimental design, it's going to be a lot easier to fit the information in once you have the skill and the concept than it to try to fit a skill or a concept.

Interviewer 1 (42:48):

Concept. Okay. And then, let's see, there was another thing in there. Oh, you mentioned when you were talking about the Gizmos, that some of them looked more realistic than others.

I do it at home with everything. So whatever activities I use I constantly fidget with and try to improve them and try to change. I have four file cabinets in my office full of every single version of a lab activity that I've done every year for 28 years now that I can go back to as I need. So just having options and maybe sometimes materials. So I know we're moving toward NGSS standards right now and it, it's not the first time that this and tried to implement it.

It's very easy to use and I'm going to be able to, I know when I go in to order, it's not going to be something that's going to take me a day. It's going to take me a couple minutes.

How do you prefer that it keep those receipts for you in case you get the dreaded audit?

Well, TPT, which is I think theirs is probably one of the best. It has a record of all my purchases, so I could go to it. I click on my name, I click on my purchases, and all of my purchases are listed right there, and I can digitally click on them and it pops up. So it saves it for me. So all my digital things are right there. Do any of the other vendors, like you mentioned,

Interviewer 1 (21:12):

Carolina and Fry, do any of them do that?

Educator (21:15):

I don't think so because there's stuff I usually use the PO and everything for, so it's a little bit different. I don't know if they do or not. I'll be honest with you. I've never had to. I know when I had the audit, I had to become like, okay, I need to know how to get this. And I could have done it individually, but I thought now there's got to be an easy way for this. So I called them and said, Hey, is there any way I can get this printed for this year and want everything I've bought for this year? And they're like, oh yeah. And then really nice about that. And that's another thing I think TPT has that a lot of the things don't is customer service is really good and fast and you get somebody on the phone right away and there you solve your problem.

Is, I don't personally use it. I just don't usually buy that much from Amazon, so I don't use it. But there is a special way we're supposed to go in and it's a special group price and everything, so it's a special way we have to go in and then we have to sign up for it and everything. And they send us all that at the beginning of the year. Amazon, and I'm trying to think, office Depot, and basically they have a contract with the school or with the district.

What is it that is missing for you in the classroom, either for you as a teacher or for students that you think should be developed?

Educator (27:10):

Wow. I think especially for beginning teachers or teachers that are beginning to teach a certain subject. I mean, it doesn't have to be somebody straight out of school, but maybe even somebody that's been teaching like me and then all of a sudden are thrown a few days before school starts, oh, you're going to teach this kind of thing. Just even units put together. So you have more of, because you see the digital stuff for a unit and you see the, oh, well, here's a lab for teaching this concept, or here's this for that. But you don't see everything bundled together. You never see. And maybe even it would be very helpful to show, okay, here's the standards, here's the essential questions that you need to ask. Here's the I can statements and stuff like that. You don't see all that bundled together. Very seldom do you see anything like that.

Sustainability.

Vocabulary,

Where it's sent, maybe phenomena, that kind of thing. And then that's all kind of wrapped together is if you're teaching sustainability, Dawn, here are all the different sources you can use.

Educator (29:04):

Right. Resources, even if it's just links to WebQuests and links to different articles and things like that. Things that you can choose from. I don't mean cookie cutter type stuff, but the choices out there for teachers that, okay, here's a lot of things that you can use and this is what each one of them covers and this is the standards that they cover and this is the essential questions you can ask. And that kind of thing.

Interviewer 1 (29:33):

There's

Educator (29:33):

Nothing out there like that that I know of. Now you can go ahead and get, if you're buying a textbook, a lot of times the textbooks will have some of those things bundled up. Of course, they're not going to have the lab supplies and things like that unless you're actually buying labs from whatever place that is. And they'll have some of those kinds of things involved in there if you buy the kits or the workbooks and all that kind of stuff. But as far as like me, I rarely, seldom pick up a textbook. We rarely pick up a textbook. We're much more news-based and article based, like journal science news type stuff. So when I find literature, that's what I'm finding. I'm not picking up a textbook and saying, okay, read from chapter. So-And-So does so-and-So doing the word boxes instead of just like, okay, write your vocabulary definitions. We're doing things like that. And so for me, having it all bundled together and having some choices to say, okay, I want to use this and I want to use that, but I've got something better than for this thing, so I'm not going to use this one, and oh, I want to do that lab out of three.

Educator (30:41):

That kind of thing.

Interviewer 1 (30:42):

So it's kick-starting things for teachers who might have adopted or adapted a new lesson that they haven't done before because teachers like yourself who've been doing this for a while, you kind of know, I want to use this resource here and this one here, but not that one.

I usually have, because I teach a lot of the general sciences, like the earth and space kind of thing, and environmental science things, I usually have a very large, not over the top, not anything I shouldn't have, but a large number of special education students.

I buy a lot of art supplies. Just kind of keep that all fully stocked depending on, especially post pandemic. What kind of hands-on things can the kids actually make instead of just producing slides or just producing a paper and especially rather than just a poster that they're going to throw out. So I've always been a poster to this idea of go home, make a poster, bring it back. I'll throw it out. I have a lot of plants in the room, a lot of them are from home. I do a ton of gardening, but I do a lot of stuff that can, oh, and I have a garden outside, so I have a large rain garden outside.

Educator (13:22):

Well, I don't know. I felt, well, I guess maybe I started off with just teaching biology that I was just more familiar with Carolina. And then as my teaching became more interdisciplinary, I just at least started to look for okay, some catalog stress, AP a little bit more maybe, or with STEM Robotics and just incredibly technological stuff has really filled up some of the catalogs versus others. So I try to shy away and I'd rather put together my own materials. That way if it's truly inquiry-based, we can come up with something more organic in the class.

I'm just going to say the students themselves. It's not about administrative pressures, it's not about things like that, but whatever it is about, I mean, I guess I should say kids today, I think I've hit a point in my career where it's kids are amazingly different than they were when I started, and they're amazingly different than they were a couple of years ago. Can you talk a little bit more about that? Well, and some of it's festered. I mean, I pay a lot of attention to motivation because that's what my research was in, but the motivation to learn is really not there. And coupled with something better to do, such as being on a phone that's an instant replacement. It's one thing to go to sleep or sit and doodle, but now there's something entirely different to do. Okay. 

Interviewer 1 (22:34):

So let's talk about the motivation first. Why do you think that has changed? 

Educator (22:47):

I think it's changed in general, and I don't know how much of it's changed rather than just become more kind of crystallized in terms of grades and points. And it's a very, I mean, I love Palo Free air and the idea of that it's just accounting and it's just numbers and it's just a work a day thing. And so with that in mind, the education really has no, doesn't have as much purpose either. And in my eyes as well as the kids' eyes, if they wanted to learn something, which a lot of them, they just do, cannot find something they want to learn about. So there's a real absence of curiosity of a spark. Creativity is really lacking. They just cannot draw something, they cannot use a ruler. So there's so much missing to their humanity. And I think that's a lot of it. And then throw in a course like environmental science, which focuses on things like climate change, which, and I love tracking it year after year that climate change has always been a difficult thing to teach and it changes how and why it's difficult. But yeah, it's a really rough world that they're trying to grow up in any way, but they can't articulate that unless I draw it out of

We talked yesterday about, there's a golf course that butts up against our athletic fields, and I had seen a diagram where basically reclaiming a golf course, putting homes, light rail, maintaining 95% of the tree cover. And I switched gears and I just threw it into the lesson that was about fracking, and I was like, this is what we should be doing. I said, how much do you think it's going to, I talked about it with my green team because they were concerned that it's going to become a warehouse that a series of warehouses, And that's what's going to happen to this land now that it's been bought. But that's the kind of thing, I mean, my research and my work is really dedicated towards, I'm tired of the phrase empowerment, but it's really activating the kids. I don't want the kids to have to wait until they're old enough to vote once every four years. But the more people that get involved, the more people can change things. So that's what needs to change is there has to be this room and this flexibility and all kinds of things and all science too.

So the relevance is to me, the absolute key. When I was just redesigning an osmosis lab, just teaching osmosis this week to kids, there are so many relevant things, whether it's my mom's dialysis or a kid drinking juice that had chlorophyll in it, but everything kept popping up as relevant. But if I was to take out the dialysis tubing that I used my first year teaching and have them spend 20 minutes trying to open it apart and do the starch and the iodine, what is any of that for? I mean, it's hard for product development because a lot of the stuff should be like kitchen kind, science, what can you find in the garage and tinker with? So it's hard, I guess the product developers could make, and some of it could be a different kind of game or different kind of manipulatives that were more affordable. I guess a lot of it's about the manipulatives really, the individual hands-on things. I've got to set a lungs over there and I've got a foam virus that comes apart and things like that. I continue to fill the room with that is for as much demonstration physical models that can really be played with rather than every kid make a mess with stuff and they spend more time playing with their gloves.

They've been building more and more sets of foldable. The origami isn't that hard, but here's a cell that you fold each piece and here's a water cycle and this kind of thing.

I'm trying to think of things like last year I had such a good time for the first time teaching about aquifers because it was so easy to make an aquifer in a shoebox size container, and then the kids could have that much more to do with it.

So again, it's one thing to have a cooler of ice and set something up on a table with ice and water and sand and structure. But if a company could put that together in an affordable way that could be put away and then taken back out. Kind like a not stream. Tables are gigantic and they need a hose, things like that. Or there's just got to be like a middle ground."

The very first thing is the customer service that I've appreciated with, I guess Carolina, because when I've had, since I never know, especially when it used to snow and things like that, when I'd need live specimens for certain lessons, we're able to call closer to when we need them. And so it was always convenient and they say, oh, we'll have it to you in two days or to know when they send it out. And so when we should call by, and then if you have any questions, there's someone to call. That's really helpful. But the other thing is also the reliability because when we go into our requisition program and they say, okay, I need such this company, and you go to order from a company and then they end up not having all that stuff.

For me, my degree is in pre-med and then I transferred into teaching biology instead of going on to becoming a doctor. And what I always felt at Northeast is that if the students are going into medicine, are we equipping them for that? So I applied for several grants and got money from the school and grants and I just bought models, dissection things for them to dissect because it's hard to tell them that the heart does this if they don't know what a heart actually looks like. So it's like we're defeating the purpose and showing them a picture in a textbook, that's great, but nothing beats like a model or dissecting a frog, dissecting a pig and actually seeing the heart and taking the heart out. So every time that I gain get money, then I buy models or dissecting kits or specimens, something that can help them because if they're going into medicine, even though it is a school in Philadelphia and we're not funded the way a suburban school, they still should get the exact same quality education as someone who is in the suburbs. So I try to make sure that I order supplies that can introduce them to what, if you're really going into healthcare medicine, these are the things that you definitely have to have or have to be able to do.

Educator (16:17):

Actually based on price, a lot of it has to do with that. Because we're a district school, we're not quite funded. You have to maximize the money that they give to you. So it's based on who has, and sometimes Flint, their prices can be a little bit cheaper and we do get I think 15% up. So if it comes out cheaper, we might as well go with Flint. But then if Flynn is out stock, because the last time we tried to order frogs, we try to order frogs, but the frogs on back order, then we just got them from Carolina. So it's based on do they have it in stock and what's the best price we're going to get because that funding has to stretch as far as possible.

Interviewer 1 (24:56):

Yeah, that's great. One of the things that came up in the survey is we talked about what makes a vendor reliable or trustworthy for you, and can you talk a little bit about what's really important to you from vendors to consider them reliable and trustworthy? So 

Educator (25:19):

Besides money, obviously money is probably going to be the number one factor, but if the kits are worth it because you can buy a kit and you're still trying to figure out what do they want me to do with this, I bought kits and the way that they assemble it, this is not for high school, it's not for our high school. So I think trustworthiness, excluding price is to understand that if you develop a kit, make sure that the wording, everything is beneficial to every school. And to understand that my students are not going to be on the same level as someone who's in a suburb. So if they have kids that I know or quality kits that I know my students are going to understand it and I know they're not going to have any difficulties with it. I think that goes along with trust. You're selling me this kit that is going to be beneficial and my students are going to learn from it. And I think that gets me to trust them over someone else.

Think socioeconomic may have a lot to do with it. I mean Philadelphia is a poorer city as compared to other cities out there. And I also feel that the kids or some of them assume that they come in with some knowledge, but if they're getting physical science before my class, which has really nothing to do with biology whatsoever, then that's a lot of learning curve that these students have to do. And if they've never, because to be honest in Philadelphia, most of the science classes is watching a Bill Knight or something like that. So they don't really get, it's focusing on reading and math until when they get to high school. Then the high school focus on science. So prior to high school it's about reading and math. So then now I'm throwing out all these biology content and they're looking at me, what am I talking about? So it's just to make sure that when kids are done, it is like you have to also take that into context as well that the language just can't be on that level because we do have some high schoolers that are not performing on their level."

Think honestly when covid happened, I think a lot of that one year, I think these students really lost a lot. And I think at least I know from my school district, and I'll be honest, if they just showed up and turn on a camera, they literally passed. So they didn't really have to do anything. So they spent literally a year and a half not being pushed to learn. So then when we got them back into that setting, they expected the same exact treatment that I didn't have to do the work where I can turn the work in whenever and I still get a grade. So I think that year and a half when we went virtual, that was detrimental to these students because I think that they never lost the fact that that wasn't really learning. We was just getting by because it was brand new to everyone. But now they have to learn and they lost a year and a half that I don't think that these students are recuperating after that. I

I think we all knew that it would. We just weren't really sure how it was going to change everything. And that makes sense of it being the root of why you're getting kids coming in at so many different levels and a lot of those populations lost people during, had people in their families die or be laid off or those kinds of things.

I think teaching wise as well, I think some teachers just got comfortable and I think when Covid happened, and I don't know, teachers just didn't know the classroom was going to open back up, that a lot of them went to different careers. So then you're left with some older teachers who are stuck in doing things in the older way that's just not working for these kids today. So I think a lot of teachers did leave the career and they left with new and bright ways of doing things, and then the people that left that stayed behind, they're not willing to change and do anything new and it's not matching with the students that we have in front of us right now.

There was a kit. It's like science kits. It's online, I think it's called Science Kits or something like that. And I was able to get one sample and the sample was really nice. It was unlevel or something like that. And then we ordered a second kit from them and it was based on the person being diabetic and they had to do the feedback loop or something like that. But the instructions were just so poorly written that I felt it was more like a college student would probably understand because they're going into all these big words pertaining to having diabetes. And my students were like, what is this? They didn't even know where to go with that kit, but it's like science kits or something like that. We ordered from it twice and I didn't order from them again because I felt like the first one was so well done that I expected it for the rest of them.

Yeah. Yeah. So that's not a great thing, right? Because you pay for it upfront. You get the initial free PD when they're trying to sell you, and then once they sell you, they kind of wave goodbye to you. But we did the pd, we set the PD up for in August. So when the teachers came back, they had that full, whatever it was. I think it was a three and a half hour part of the day that they had the intro. Again, basically the full intro into the program might've been June or July. We did that. I think we did it before the actual school year started, but that was part of the payment.

Company to company, so I can use a little leverage, a little leverage with our, we pretty much know who we're going to go with, but I always like to get the bids and then maybe see if they'll throw something else in or take a little bit off or promise that if we grow, we'll be able to get, because we cut it pretty close on our consumables year to year, and usually they'll throw in three or four extra fours.

So we have a purchasing process. They fill out a requisition, an online requisition comes to the building principal. We probably buy more maintenance and items like that on Amazon supplies than we do teacher material though, and teacher supplies. But anyway, it goes through an ere, what we call an ere and electronic requisition process. And then the building principals approve it, and the district office initially gets to it and we approve it.

Actually, I guess I didn't mention that. I also, during the summers I do a forensics camp for high schoolers. So with that, creating that avenue of science enrichment, I purchased all of the stuff that would go with that as far as kits and reading material for students to have even on hand that we'd kind of get that cross curricular connection so that they could read historical stuff about forensics or biographies from forensics artists or forensic scientists. And so bought lots of stuff through that. And I also tried to look for things that I could also use in my classroom with limited time for labs, but you still want to give them that experience.

Base it off of the AP curriculum or the state curriculum and look for materials that can help me to teach different areas of the curriculum through living organisms. So for example, we do a lot with composting and AP environmental science. I use the compost bins not only to teach about alternatives to waste disposal, but also to show the students the nutrient density in composted soil versus soil that we dig up outside.

Educator (05:02):

Oh, that's

Educator (05:03):

Cool. Live red worms. In order to maintain my compost bins, currently my students have aquatic e I'm looking around my room currently. My students have aquatic ecosystem set up and they're testing for nutrient cycling. So your nitrogen, your phosphorus, your sulfur compounds, and how the different organisms contribute to those. And so they monitor the levels week by week. I use aloia in biology so the students can observe plant cells under the microscope. So those are some of the ways that we use live items.

Educator (05:41):

So besides the fact that it's part of the standards, I bet I'm guessing that your students are really interested in the topics that you're teaching. It sounds like you're connecting to a lot of their

Educator (05:57):

Well, I think the live items help them to connect. It's real, it's tangible. It's not just a preserved specimen or a slide that's been prepared. So they feel like they're more connected to the material and I think it helps them remember the content better.

Educator (06:13):

So I plan what I want to buy with my budget based off of either past experience labs that I know are successful or things that I'm like, this is really boring or this is lacking. Let me see how I can kind of beef it up and I'll look for materials that way. And so for us, when we're in the website that we use, it pulls from several different catalogs. So I will search for whatever topic I'm looking for if I'm looking for a specific item, and then it'll show me where it appears in several different catalogs and I can look at, are there prepackaged kits, am I going to piece it together on my own?

Or sometimes I'll say, well, I can get more because cheaper here. So it depends. Sometimes I have a little to draw on to say, well, I like the quality from this company versus that. And then if they can't fulfill that bid or if something goes wrong, then I have the opportunity to say, okay, I'll take it from somewhere else.

With the kits? I would say that happens. I find that I get, once I've used the kit, a lot of times I'll then piecemeal it together myself. For example, I have a kit that you need test strips for, and they'll mail you the kit and the test strips are almost or already expired, where if I order them separately, I can guarantee some of the quality control versus what comes prepackaged. So while I like having it all in one box, and it's a good starting point for me to know how to run the lab, what materials I need, then after the fact, a lot of times I don't find the quality of those kits to be consistent enough to keep reordering them and then use the content and replicate that experiment, but I'll piecemeal the equipment myself.

Really. I'm running a lab with eggs, chicken, eggs, and I needed vinegar, chicken, eggs and maple syrup. Well, those are three things that are cheaper at ShopRite than anywhere else, and I need them fresh. So we just, there's a team of biology teachers. Most of us carry out the same lab and one person will say, all right, I'm going to go get the ShopRite card. We have a budget on our ShopRite card. We have to provide the lab, and then we have to provide a receipt of all the materials we purchased, who's using them, how many students, and then it gets submitted to our board office.

Educator (30:39):

You're very lucky there too because we've talked to some teachers that it comes right out of their pocket if they don't get it within their budget.

Educator (30:47):

Yeah, no, we are very lucky. Sometimes it's a paint and you'll just run to the store and pick it up yourself. It saves time. No one has to organize it and you have to submit all the paperwork. And this is bigger because we need a hundred eggs and X number of gallons of vinegar and maple syrup. But something that's quick that I do with just my classes, I'm going to buy it at ShopRite on my own to save myself time. But no, we are very fortunate here.

I think that one area that would really be helpful is state specific materials that meet state, like I mentioned, our state science tests. There's very little out there that supports the way in which that I can present to my students that supports the way in which they're tested. So like I explained earlier, we went through a process of looking for digital software to help support our students in that area, or even some inquiry-based better specific to that kind of learning that would help them achieve better scores on those standardized tests that are not across the board. Every state handles things differently. So that would be an area where I think that we would really find a lot of help in because it's hard. It's kind of like we're chasing this moving target, which is why I don't think companies have really gotten involved in it either.

So a lot of those resources give the students, alright, we're going to have you collect data for two weeks and then we're going to let you choose how you'd like to manipulate and collect some more data. So there's a lot of differentiation already built into those types of assessments or laboratories on more of a standard level course where you see a wide variety of students. A lot of that differentiation comes from us. We create it so we will provide for the students more of the like, all right, if you've mastered this, then let's move on to this.

Educator (38:15):

Accelerate. Yeah, I would say that there's not a lot out there. What we do have, we really work together to come up with, we have really great support from our special ed team. I am fortunate enough to team teach, so a lot of that comes from them or us brainstorming and putting together things as a team where my blind spots are kind of covered by them and vice versa. And so we can come together and they'll point out, and we have a really great child study team that will say, I have a blind student this year. And so she brought to my attention that as long as I put it in this format, then the student has the opportunity to change all of these different factors to make it more helpful for her. I would've never known that it was an easy switch for me and really enhanced her learning. Not that she was struggling. The student happens to be really a phenomenal student who just really goes and gets it, but we made it easier for her so that she didn't have to climb a mountain every time she did a task.

I've had some really interesting students over the years. So my AP class, that's my passion, so I really focus on it. And I actually, I work for college board also. I'm an AP reader, so I always try and innovate as they do. They share things with us. And so I always have two or three weeks after the AP test where you're like, what am I going to do? And so that's where I try and push them for, you took this class for a reason. You've hopefully gotten your AP credit. Where are we going to go from here? And so whatever their interest is in environmental science, which is a huge spectrum, I try and have them choose something and then do a project with it. So maybe an internship. So one year I had a girl who wanted to be an architect, so she went and found an architect in the Houston area who was focused on sustainable methods of forestry. She helped them find better lumberyards that used more harvestable timber that was better for the planet. And then they actually started changing the way that they designed buildings to use the better lumber in different ways and wrote a paper about it, which was really fascinating. And I don't know anything about architecture, but it was interesting to learn.

Interviewer 1 (20:46):

What a wonderful, that's really interesting. Any others that you can think of?

Educator (20:55):

I've had some students do some really cool projects with Arduino, which is something they can code to do different things. A lot of students are focused on recycling efforts. Our campus does not because it's not cost effective in our region. We're trying to encourage our food and nutrition department to switch away from styrofoam trays in the lunchroom. So students are advocating for that. That's something they started this week. I had a student a few years ago who found a way to make reusable expo markers so you could just pull the tube out from the middle. And so they made a product design. They were like, teachers throw these away all the time, and they're not really recyclable. They get thrown out of the facilities. So I was like, mean, those are good ideas.

Interviewer 1 (21:39):

And those are the kind of global challenges that kids that are in high school right now are going to be needing to deal with. My son is 21 and he mentions from time to time that prior generations have ruined the entire planet for him and that he and his generation that are going to have to deal with a lot of the fallout from it. And I see that in a lot of the projects you're talking about there. So that's interesting. Let me see what else I've got on here. Okay. So we talked about video resources possibly for teachers or students just to kind of get them ready for what they're going to do. Do you use any simulations or interactive programs?"

We have classroom phones, but they don't ring because we're teaching. They're shut off by the district. It's sometimes difficult with any business for them to understand that while a school is kind of a business, we're not really someone that you can constantly be in contact with.

If I'm going to have to spend 30 or 45 minutes every time I try to get this activity going or whatever, if I've got to type everything up to put the questions in to play this game or whatever it is, the more work that I have to do, the less likely it is I'm going to do it again. And if having tech support available or pre-made tech stuff, if that's a thing, pre-made games, quiz games, that kind of stuff that would be worth paying for if it was easy to use.

I have caught them getting distracted many a times. One kid today in Environmental was watching a video of wrestling and I had to go over and be like, no, that's not what we're doing right now. It's different with the different levels that I teach. So my cp, my lower level classes, I give them their work on paper still and they'll use their iPads kind of as more support. My accelerated students do everything on their iPad. They don't get paper, they write everything they use notability write in there, they'll open up the stuff, whatever educational tools we're using, it's all on. There's nothing on paper so they can still get distracted, but it's quick to notice and you kind of learn quickly which kids are more likely to get sidetracked and start watching a video or doing whatever else it is they want to do. And because they're iPads, we can use Apple Classroom so I can pull up their screens while they're in class and watch their screens. So they took a test in biology yesterday on mitosis in Google Forms and as they're taking their test, I have all their screens on my iPad in front of me and I can see where they are so they can be monitored still.

She didn't tell us specific numbers, just that we needed to cut our budgets down.

So what did you cut and what did you keep?

Educator (17:54):

What did I cut? I had had a higher budget because of the previous years. Our school is very weird. We actually, we just got a new supervisor this year and he was very confused by our budgeting protocol because we're not given a number, we're just told to make our budget and then our supervisor presents that budget to the board of education and they will either accept it or reject it. I don't know all of the details of what happens there, but we get told in the fall to make your budget and one of my first few years here, a coworker was like, make your budget high because if you start low you're never going to get more money, but if you have a higher number then you can keep that higher number and get more stuff.

So I have models, I have a muscle man, I have a model of skin anatomy and all those things are expensive, so my budget was a little bit higher, so I cut out some of those things. Some of those models that I have already accumulated now no longer need, so I cut some of that stuff out. And also I like to try out different kits, so I'll search the different websites and see what they have that might fit with our curriculum and those can vary in price. So I think I cut out a few of those just to bring things down a little bit. But the consumables are things that have to stay on there.

That I use, they create different size cubes of agar with penal failing. They're different colors and you put it in a solution of I think base and they turn clear. So you can see that bigger cells have more trouble getting materials in and smaller cells can get the materials quickly. So it's difficult to be a larger cell. It's easier to be a smaller cell. That one, it's the same deal where I don't use the worksheet that came with the kit. I made my own and it's actually the one that I use. We'd really just use it as a thing to look at. So they are able to do the little activity, they follow my directions for it and they record the data. I don't use the worksheet that came with that one. I like there's other in here, I have a bunch of these resource sustainability ego kits that I tried using with my one class last year and it was way too hard for them. They couldn't follow along. So I might try again this year to edit the worksheet to make it make more sense to them, but that's one of those, I only have so much time so I have to decide what gets edited and what I have what that is.

The foam kits another coworker had ordered and I really liked them and we kind of decided to collaborate on that. The other ones I've decided on my own just searching through. Most of these are from Carolina or Flynn, so I searched through their websites that I see what stands out to me. I have another one, I don't know where it's in here, but I know I used it on antibiotic resistance and I did use a lot of the worksheet that came along with that one and just modified it slightly and modified the numbers to fit my classes. So I just search through the websites and I see what I think is interesting, what fits with our curriculum and what can work for my classroom. So I have six lab tables in my classroom, so I always work in groups of six, so I have to make sure that the activity will kind of fit for my students. It's usually six groups of four, sometimes a group of five. So I make sure that the kit comes along with enough materials that would fulfill that need.

Yeah, I usually go unit by unit. If you look at the years a whole, it usually gets way too overwhelming and I'll kind of target one unit at a time. A lot of the activities I have fit into the ecology unit because that's where you can kind of do more hands-on stuff. But some of the other ones we have fit with the DNA, trying to find things that kind of fit in the units that are a little bit more difficult to understand. I might for next year I'm going to probably look for stuff for environmental science. This is my first year teaching environmental science, so I'm kind of getting a feel for it and what I've found based on the current environmental curriculum is that it's not great and it needs a lot more hands-on labs.

(27:43):

So I'm going to probably go through and look and see if I can find any lab activities that will fit into the units. So they've done, I'm looking at my files, ecology populations, biodiversity and energy so far and I have some labs in energy already, but I could use a few in earlier units. They did one yesterday using solar panels that I only kind of liked. So I actually did a quick search for solar panel kits the other day to try to find a better lab. I didn't find anything that fit what I wanted, so I kind of tossed that off to the side, but I just kind of look to see what is out there that might fit. Would it fit in any of those units? They're going to talk about water next. I think that we already have a few water labs, but is there anything else that I like? Can I find a lab that will cover some of our standards and fits in with the unit we're teaching, stuff like that.

Interviewer 1 (28:41):

There was. I went to one probably five years ago. We in anatomy use anatomy and clay and so I went to a training on anatomy and clay up in somewhere in North Jersey. I went with two other coworkers and we went to a whole training session on it. So that one, yes, otherwise no.

Interviewer 1 (33:47):

So you said anatomy and clay and it was familiar with it, so for a couple of days and was it worth it?

Educator (33:57):

Yes, yes. We only went to one of the two days. It was like a Friday and Saturday and we were only able to go to the Friday day and so it went through, I did, I still remember it because I remember that the presenter had an interesting style of going through things where he would talk and have you work and then play a video and it led me to incorporate short video clips into my teaching now to break it up because I'm being like, oh, it's really boring to hear one person talk all the time. And so I insert short little video clips to try to pull students' attention now. So yeah, in that sense was I learned a little bit more about the anatomy and clay materials. I like the structure, but I had already learned a lot about them at that point from having my students done it, having done it previous two years. But we also got a new skeleton and we needed more skeletons so it was beneficial.

Interviewer 1 (34:50):

Okay. I'm going to circle back a little bit, but first I'm going to ask you about or have you take a minute to talk about where you would like to see your classroom in the next five years in the sense of what could be hands-on, and if you were talking about not having a well both within budget and just pie in the sky, what would it look like?"

I think definitely being able to include more hands-on activities in different units particularly we just did or I did in some of my classes I'm about to do in others myosis. I have a student teacher this year and I was joking with her that this is my seventh year trying to teach myosis and crossing over and I still have not found a lab that I like. I've made my own, I've edited other ones, still have not found something. So ideally finding things that actually work to effectively teach my students all of the concepts in hands-on ways because myosis is complicated. So last year I made a lab where they used pipe cleaners to model each step of myosis and they did not get it. It went right over their heads and I was like, all right, I spent days making this lesson that I'm going to throw in the trash and never try again because tried it three times, failed three times was like, okay.

(36:25):

And so I'm still looking for better. I have a crossing lab for my accelerated level kids that I think works for them, but I'm still working on trying to find one for my lower level students and they offer or they present more challenges a lot of the time because the concepts have to be made more basic and there's often more behavioral concerns as well. So the lesson needs to be easy enough that they can follow. It needs to be engaging enough that they will stay on task and it can't have materials that they can throw at one another or cause danger, which it's hard to get all of those things.

Interviewer 1 (37:01):

So in a theoretical amazing world, I would love to have lots of activities like that

Educator (37:05):

That can be done without them causing chaos. And of course it's a mix. It's not like it's just the materials, it's the students and the materials and you have to find the right balance because I have certain groups of kids, I have a group this year that would not throw materials at one another. They would probably be okay, but they need kind of those more basic concepts. Last year they could probably handle more challenging concepts, but they would throw things at one another and so it needed to be more of they had to be vigilantly watched to make sure that they would follow along.

Interviewer 1 (37:39):

I

Educator (37:40):

Do labs. I use a lot of beans for different things. I can, can't think of an example right now. My environmental students count them when we talked about populations and tagging species to calculate potential population size. So that's one that comes to mind. And then I end up with beans everywhere and my accelerated students in environmental are a little bit older. They're more mature, mostly less likely to throw them at one another. But even stuff like that, they throw it at one another. So that's kind of my cheat to a lot of activities is that I use random materials like that. Anyway, back to your initial question."

Yeah, definitely more hands-on things. I like using new technology. I liked the solar panel activity we did the other day. They got to use a real solar panel, they got to connect it to a circuit. I saw some online that had them building their own solar panels. I thought stuff like that would be cool. I have seen, I'm trying to think of what units are coming up that are things that I would aim for or strive for. Looking at our list of units, I Definitely, I need more things for photosynthesis and cellular respiration. There's a lot out there, but sometimes they don't all work, right, or you have to have certain things. So there's one, it's probably just that I don't have the materials for it that uses, you take little discs of spinach, you punch out spinach discs and you put them in a syringe and you mix it up I think with baking soda and you can see the change in numbers, but it's partially a supply issue. So getting supplies so that I could do all of those labs easily. You need lamps for a light source. Sometimes you need different colors of light. That would be another example. I did the solar panel lab yesterday and what I found,

I sometimes we'll just buy on my own bigger things I budget for, but it's hard because I have to plan in October what I need the next year before I've even taught that year. And in the last years they've started letting us edit it again in the spring as long as we stay under our initial number. So now I can go through and revise and kind of write things down, and now I've learned the trick that I add things that I don't need in the fall so that I can take them out of my budget and add in other things that I realize I need throughout the year."

I throw those out and buy new ones and I do more agar. So those are the things that I know have to be added to my list, and then I'll see how much money I have left over.

Feel like that partially ties into what I said about I get these materials and then the worksheets aren't good and they have to be modified. I modify them for the different levels, so I'll modify them for my accelerated class and then I'll modify again for my CP level students to make it more clear to them what needs to be done. And that's typically the case. A lot of our labs are very similar across the board for both of the levels, but they've been simplified or the wording has changed for my students that struggle more or I'll go through, they were taking a quiz yesterday in my lower level class. It was open note, but I went around to certain kids and I'll just kind of cross off a few options. I'll be like, it's not going to be that, or something along those lines.

Catching up

Educator (44:17):

Absent. Yes. Those are always fun, and I usually have a handful of kids that are absent frequently. Some of them are good at making stuff up, some are not. Their work is all on Google Classroom, so I always tell 'em they can find anything. My accelerated kids, their work is on their every day. They do it on their every day so they can find whatever they're missing when they're absent. I post everything for my CP students as well. The only time that it comes to be a little bit of a problem is when they do a lab. For my students that were absent from environmental yesterday, I had the data. I took a screenshot of it, I emailed it to them. I said, here's the data for the lab that you missed yesterday. If you have questions, come in to see me during lunch, we'll go over it. A few of them will be able to do on their own without any trouble. One or two of them I will be nagging about for the next week and a half before our semester ends that they need to get it done.

Yeah. I have a coworker who started last year. It was her first year teaching. She was going to be absent one day and she left them an activity with her in class support teacher where they had to cut things and glue them on paper and she was like, Rebecca, I came in the next day and my room was a disaster zone. I was like, yeah, they have trouble cutting and gluing. Basic stuff like that is often hard. It takes a lot. If I plan to have them cut things out, I budget extra time because I know it will take them a while to do that, particularly for my lower level students where just sometimes following directions, processing time takes them a little bit longer, but hire students, I'll make them do it, but I account for the fact that I know it will take them time. My environmental kids used a protractor yesterday. I went around to be like, do we know how to use a protractor? Can you show me that you know how to use this just to make sure that they are doing it correctly. They do definitely need refreshers on skills that one might have thought at one point where basic skills are not so much anymore.

Interviewer 1 (46:35):

Do you have another example of something like that?

Educator (46:41):

We have rulers. This makes sense, right? We're a science classroom. We measure things. Some of my rulers are labeled in millimeters. Some of them are labeled in centimeters and they cannot always distinguish. So I have to carefully pick and put out all millimeter ones or all centimeter ones, and then I talk about how to read a ruler and how to write the number and how we write the number in units. So if we're measuring 10 centimeters, a hundred millimeters, let's write the correct number.

Interviewer 1 (47:21):

Is this something that you're seeing as a trend? Is this or from even when you first started teaching to now? Is it because they are using the iPad all the time? Do you have any theory?

Educator (47:39):

I think it's gotten maybe a little bit worse, but I think they had trouble with it even a while ago, but I also taught more of my lower level kids, and that's where I see more of these problems, more of my mid and higher level kids can usually figure it out.

The differentiation in lab materials that are provided would be really helpful, and I think a lot of the time they make materials and they're very theoretical. I could look at something and be like, yeah, in theory, this lab is great, but in actuality it's not going to work in my room. So having different options and there's different websites that have teachers collaborate or upload things, stuff like that's useful. One of the reasons I think I like the Gizmo website is because a lot of their worksheets that go along with the activities are actually really good. I don't have to make a lot of changes, so I can go and edit a couple of things and it's set and it's ready to go. Other things that I buy, it's like the materials here are great, but I have to make a whole lesson to go along with it. So create a variety of activities that could potentially go with materials and creating different levels, because sometimes they're way too complex and the time it takes to simplify them. I just have to make my own at that point.

Now at that point in June, they did not tell me that I had to repeat that process every four and a half weeks. But they told me that part of our state requirement is that they, that they're doing some sort of lab experiment. So then we had to come up with ways that we were doing some of the labs that the kids really like and get a lot out of in the classroom. In the in-person setting, I had to spend a lot of my June and first part of July figuring out how we could take and do those labs or tailor them to how they could do 'em at home. And so it was a lot of, well, we use this but it's glass and I really don't want to send glass home or what can they use in their kitchen type thing. And so a lot of the stuff that we have bought, at least for me has been lab kits that do have a lot of plastic parts and that will service 30 kits or that we could quickly replicate and rebuy more materials to send those home.

How many lab kits would service 30 students? Do you need 30 because they're going home?

Yeah, we would have, because each kid, so if they're in it all kind of depends because each school is allotted a certain number of seats in this program.

Not off the top of my head because I know some of 'em we have had to honestly go to Dollar Tree and buy plastic cups and things like that to put them with, and I know some of them were still a work in progress of figuring out exactly what to go with. But my in-person class for me personally because there's not enough time between teaching virtually and teaching in person as well, which is a complete separate class. So I do do a lot of the pre-made kits for those. And I know I have done the Macromolecule lab for wards this year. That was a pre-made kit. I have done it is from, hold on, I'm trying to, we did a gel electrophoresis from another company that was a pre-done kit.

They give us definitely two, so Word and Flynn to use right off the bat because they do have the contract pricing or special district pricing that does give us a discount. But other than that, they don't specify that we have to use certain people.

Interviewer 1 (36:05):

Okay. Let's see. I had another question along that and it just flew out because I haven't had enough caffeine yet, which is why I'm hugging this mug right now. Let's see. So one of the questions that we asked on the survey was a little bit about trust and reliability and those types of things. What does it mean to you that a vendor is reliable for you?"

That they can get me the item or that they had the item available to me and they can get it to me in a reasonable amount of time and things like that. What

Interviewer 1 (36:48):

Is reasonable amount of time for you?

Educator (36:51):

For the most part, if order something, unless it's a course, the summertime and I'm not in the building, I probably need it within two weeks. There have been times that according to a vendor's website that it's been in stock and I send it and they go to order it and it's telling me that it's out of stock or it's back ordered for three or four weeks, or I end up having to order it or buy it. We'll just say from Walmart for example, and then it comes in because it's not getting to me quick enough."

After it's purchased.

Interviewer 1 (37:30):

Okay. Let's imagine for a minute that you could know upfront if it was back ordered, what would you do differently?"

I would either a look for a different vendor that would have it and be able to get it to me in the timeframe that I need it or try to come up with something different to use and it's like an alternative.

Interviewer 1 (37:59):

Okay. Okay. So that's helpful. Let me think. I'm just flipping through my questions here to see, oh, does your district have an Amazon account or is Amazon not an option? How does that work for you guys?"
847,Vendor Comparison,"Sarah Webster mentions that Amazon is an option for purchasing, but the district prefers to check with approved vendors first.",0.1,,[],38:18,38:33,R_2xPqCS7rFQBwAmu,Sarah,Dorey Webster,sdoreyweb@wcboe.org,1981-1996,James M Bennett Senior High School,Wicomico County Public Schools,Salisbury,MD,Science Teacher,"Life Sciences (e.g. Biology, Environmental, Anatomy & Physiology)","Biology,Anatomy and Physiology,Environmental Science","Flinn, Science world, Carolina",Current Vendor,Aware of (don't use),Current Vendor,Aware of (don't use),Aware of (don't use),Never heard of,Current Vendor,Current Vendor,Aware of (don't use),Current Vendor,Current Vendor,Current Vendor,"Carolina Biological,Wards/VWR","Discounts,Favorable terms for districts: up to 90 days",4-9 years,2,"Educator (38:18):

We do, and Amazon's an option, but in most purchases they try it. They want us to make sure that it's not available through one of the vendor, the major prior approved vendors first.

Interviewer 1 (38:33):

Okay. Let's see. The other thing that I was thinking, just knowing that you are using Flynn and Morts too, does your school or district, do any of the classes do dissections or have a need for dissections?"
848,Purchasing Patterns,"Sarah Webster talks about how dissections are handled in different biology classes, indicating the decision to dissect is up to teacher preference.",0.1,,[],38:54,39:45,R_2xPqCS7rFQBwAmu,Sarah,Dorey Webster,sdoreyweb@wcboe.org,1981-1996,James M Bennett Senior High School,Wicomico County Public Schools,Salisbury,MD,Science Teacher,"Life Sciences (e.g. Biology, Environmental, Anatomy & Physiology)","Biology,Anatomy and Physiology,Environmental Science","Flinn, Science world, Carolina",Current Vendor,Aware of (don't use),Current Vendor,Aware of (don't use),Aware of (don't use),Never heard of,Current Vendor,Current Vendor,Aware of (don't use),Current Vendor,Current Vendor,Current Vendor,"Carolina Biological,Wards/VWR","Discounts,Favorable terms for districts: up to 90 days",4-9 years,2,"Educator (38:54):

So as far as dissections, our anatomy classes dissect and then biology, I'll say most of our biology teachers will dissect, but it is after our end of course assessment. So normally we have at least three weeks from when we're done state testing for the end of course assessment until the course actually ends. And so that's when we do the dissection piece. And again, it's teacher preference for me in the past. Last year was the first year that my kids have ever even wanted to dissect, and so last year was the first year we dissected, but again, it's completely up to the teacher preference what we do as far as dissections and when we do 'em.

Interviewer 1 (39:45):

Okay. You mentioned assessments and it sounds like the work that you do up prior to the assessments is really important and that maybe the more fun stuff or the extended learning comes after the assessment. So tell me a little bit about how you get students ready for their assessments."
851,Vendor Comparison,Preference for Flinn is due to legacy and convenience of collective orders to save on shipping.,0.2,,[],43:48,44:20,R_2xPqCS7rFQBwAmu,Sarah,Dorey Webster,sdoreyweb@wcboe.org,1981-1996,James M Bennett Senior High School,Wicomico County Public Schools,Salisbury,MD,Science Teacher,"Life Sciences (e.g. Biology, Environmental, Anatomy & Physiology)","Biology,Anatomy and Physiology,Environmental Science","Flinn, Science world, Carolina",Current Vendor,Aware of (don't use),Current Vendor,Aware of (don't use),Aware of (don't use),Never heard of,Current Vendor,Current Vendor,Aware of (don't use),Current Vendor,Current Vendor,Current Vendor,"Carolina Biological,Wards/VWR","Discounts,Favorable terms for districts: up to 90 days",4-9 years,2,"Educator (43:48):

I mean, for me, I'm pretty loyal to Flynn and that's just my go-to, and I think part of that is that's who, for the most part, the teachers that were here when I first started, those were their go-tos and it was just, oh, we can do one big collective order and save on shipping. And a lot of it's just who they had had, I don't want to say preference, but preference with before I started working here.

Interviewer 1 (44:20):

So kind of a legacy impairment. Yeah, basically. And is there anything that would make you, if everybody's ordering something from Flynn, is there anything that would make you really advocate for switching?"

I'll voice my opinion and maybe for me, I'm always trying to get the best deal for my money, so we'll just say if wards has something that if we buy it at a bigger quantity, but in the long run when we dish it out into smaller quantities that it's actually going to be cheaper. I sit down and look at the money. But I also, that's just my mentality of trying to make sure that I have enough to go through all year, but also trying to save and conserve and all that kind of stuff.

Interviewer 1 (45:13):

Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. Stepping back now and looking at the big picture and knowing that this is your opportunity really to speak directly to people who can make a difference in what's available for teachers and for students, what would you like to see that doesn't already exist?"
853,Customer Experience,Sarah desires pre-lab kits for convenience and time-saving during prep work.,0.3,,[],45:40,47:04,R_2xPqCS7rFQBwAmu,Sarah,Dorey Webster,sdoreyweb@wcboe.org,1981-1996,James M Bennett Senior High School,Wicomico County Public Schools,Salisbury,MD,Science Teacher,"Life Sciences (e.g. Biology, Environmental, Anatomy & Physiology)","Biology,Anatomy and Physiology,Environmental Science","Flinn, Science world, Carolina",Current Vendor,Aware of (don't use),Current Vendor,Aware of (don't use),Aware of (don't use),Never heard of,Current Vendor,Current Vendor,Aware of (don't use),Current Vendor,Current Vendor,Current Vendor,"Carolina Biological,Wards/VWR","Discounts,Favorable terms for districts: up to 90 days",4-9 years,2,"Educator (45:40):

For me, I, like I said, pre-lab kits, so some of those already exist, but pre-lab or pre set kits for pretty much all labs so that there's not a whole lot of leg, I don't want to say legwork, but there's not a whole lot of prep work on my backend. And again, a lot of that's just for time because the classroom that I am in for my in-person class, it's used all day. So either I would have to come in before school or after school to set up a lab. And so if I do set up a lab, I have to set it up on a cart to be able to wheel in and out of a storage area. And so definitely things that are maybe more shelf stable meaning so that I could set them up three or four days in advance because once a week I do have an additional 40 minutes that I am able to be in that classroom, but I can't necessarily teach or do labs, so I could use that as additional prep time.

Interviewer 1 (46:48):

So this is just me not being a teacher. What is a pre-lab kit? What is A pre-lab? So a lab that is basically everything is already in that kit. So the

Educator (47:04):

858,Buying Habits,"Mr. Ruber-Strohm starts his purchasing process by engaging students with interesting topics to elicit questions, which guide his material selection.",0.3,,[],06:57,07:53,R_11bIskMPuh55EKW,Gregory,Ruber,ruberg@eths202.org,1981-1996,Evanston Township High School,Evanston Township High School Dist 202,Evanston,IL,Science Teacher,"Life Sciences (e.g. Biology, Environmental, Anatomy & Physiology)","Biology,Honors Biology","Basic, thermofisher, ..Amazon ",Current Vendor,Current Vendor,Current Vendor,Aware of (don't use),Aware of (don't use),Aware of (don't use),Aware of (don't use),Aware of (don't use),Never heard of,Current Vendor,Current Vendor,Never heard of,"Carolina Biological,Amazon","District approved vendor,Free shipping (unlimited),Fast delivery (three days or less)",4-9 years,9,"Educator (06:57):

I start that process by asking the students. So I present the students with something interesting, or at least what I think is interesting, something that I hope is going to cause 'em to ask a lot of questions. And then it's designing stuff around those questions. Now, granted being a sneaky teacher, I know what their questions are going to be. So one of the phenomenon that I selected, for example, is cancer. So it's not a happy thing, but it evokes interest and that for the most part, I know what your average 14, 15-year-old is going to be asking about that disease and what they want to know. So once I get those questions, that's what I start with. Whenever I'm working off of designing or working with or deciding what I'm going to be using and purchasing in materials is to see if those are things that are going to directly lead to an experience to my students being able to answer those questions that they have as scientists.

Interviewer 2 (07:53):

I'm going to ask you two questions on that one. When you come up with your ideas for them, are they standards based or do you truly just say, let's do cancer?"
860,Purchasing Experience,"Mr. Ruber-Strohm seeks various resources annually to guide students through the NGSS storyline, adjusting teaching methods to suit the cohort.",0.2,,[],09:34,10:29,R_11bIskMPuh55EKW,Gregory,Ruber,ruberg@eths202.org,1981-1996,Evanston Township High School,Evanston Township High School Dist 202,Evanston,IL,Science Teacher,"Life Sciences (e.g. Biology, Environmental, Anatomy & Physiology)","Biology,Honors Biology","Basic, thermofisher, ..Amazon ",Current Vendor,Current Vendor,Current Vendor,Aware of (don't use),Aware of (don't use),Aware of (don't use),Aware of (don't use),Aware of (don't use),Never heard of,Current Vendor,Current Vendor,Never heard of,"Carolina Biological,Amazon","District approved vendor,Free shipping (unlimited),Fast delivery (three days or less)",4-9 years,9,"Educator (09:34):

Get students to ask questions and then I gather those questions and then I as the teacher am trying to find materials and it's just things that I can utilize in some way to help guide students through what we call an NGSS, like the storyline that ideally they're going through and developing the story and ultimately at the end they're figuring out what is cancer, how does it work, kind of thing. So that's the next step is any number of things. And realistically, every year I try different things to see what works best. I've tried this and that and starting with this and trying this approach because realistically you can come at it from all different directions and it's partially influenced by the students that year. Sometimes every so often there's a little bit of change or there's something topical, but by and large I'm looking for stuff that hopefully gets that answered their questions.

Interviewer 2 (10:29):

So where do you get that stuff? Is it like kits? Where do you get it?"
862,Customer Experience,Mr. Ruber-Strohm values Facebook groups and resources from Dr. Jason Green for pedagogical insights and teaching strategies.,0.4,,[],11:50,13:24,R_11bIskMPuh55EKW,Gregory,Ruber,ruberg@eths202.org,1981-1996,Evanston Township High School,Evanston Township High School Dist 202,Evanston,IL,Science Teacher,"Life Sciences (e.g. Biology, Environmental, Anatomy & Physiology)","Biology,Honors Biology","Basic, thermofisher, ..Amazon ",Current Vendor,Current Vendor,Current Vendor,Aware of (don't use),Aware of (don't use),Aware of (don't use),Aware of (don't use),Aware of (don't use),Never heard of,Current Vendor,Current Vendor,Never heard of,"Carolina Biological,Amazon","District approved vendor,Free shipping (unlimited),Fast delivery (three days or less)",4-9 years,9,"Educator (11:50):

I trust them as a starting point. I trust them as maybe like an idea bank. Honestly, the Facebook groups have some of the most influential things, which is really cool. It's just seeing what other people are doing. I trust them in the sense that it's other biology teachers, they're doing things. I'm not naive to the fact that there are biology teachers who teach very boringly and quite plainly, but I am still able to get inspired by those things and then utilize that to try to construct my own thing, I suppose.

Interviewer 2 (12:28):

Is there a particular Facebook group that you like?

Educator (12:34):

There's one that's literally just called NGSS biology teachers, and then I've also pulled some from the Illinois storylines by Dr. Jason Green. He's just cool and I happen to be friends with his friends. I suppose just someone who's really, really good at Storylining, I think I'm decent at it, but he's really good at going into the full on pedagogy and really getting into the nitty gritty of it, the documentation and stuff and just that stuff. And then in terms of other places for inspiration, literally publications like actual written research that I feel like I could try to translate for students, I suppose it just really depends on what their questions are, I guess.

Interviewer 2 (13:24):

So you've done that part well first actually, can you in a sentence or two say what for our note purposes, so I don't put words in your mouth, what storylining is?"

I purchase lab supplies. Sometimes it's from local places, like I'll go to the grocery store or Dollar Tree. Literally. One of the reasons why I'm a little bit late is because I went to Dollar Tree to pick up some things because doing a lab experience ish tomorrow and I came up with the idea today, of course I will also order or I'll get a lot of stuff from Home Depot and Lowe's, honestly, because plants and stuff. But in terms of science equipment, largely Flynn, Carolina Biological Supply, and I really think those are the big two I and really maybe just some frivolous things from Amazon.

In my school we have either, if it's through Amazon, it's a business account that we use, so we have our own login for that and then my boss approves it. And then business department, if it's stuff that I go and do the shopping myself, I just get the receipt, I have a tax exempt card, I get the receipt and then I get reimbursed after I submit it to my office, to my science department chair. We're a really big school, so I have the, A portion I immediately report to is in charge of 40 science teachers.

Interviewer 2 (18:23):

How do you use them or how do you decide you're going to do, do you have a catalog? I mean, when you're kind of brainstorming your ideas and then you say, oh, I'll look at or what do you

Educator (18:35):

Yeah, I'll be honest. So let's see. I think over my years, some of the labs that I have, I've made myself out of my own knowledge from undergrad in grad school. They're labs that I myself did in high school or they're labs that I asked someone for. I saw that they were setting it up and I was like, Ooh, what are you doing over there? Kind of thing. It's like interdepartmental sharing or it is a lab that I just found and I was like, this is the coolest thing ever. I'd like to try this. And then it's trying to figure out like, okay, they use Petri dishes or pipettes or I have basic supplies, but what unique things do I need to find? I'd like to do a terrarium lab, so I need to go over to Target and get a bunch of containers that can act as terrariums. And then I got to go over here and I got to get which soil do I need to get? And just experimenting with stuff I suppose.

Interviewer 2 (19:30):

Would you like those things to be in a kit? Would you be a kit teacher?"

It would be convenient if that was available. I feel like sometimes teachers, at least I statements, I as a teacher tend to do such personalized things that I almost screw myself over by doing that because I make it so personalized that kits can't possibly apply to me. And I've tried to make my life easier by being a little bit more flexible. But I would be open to the idea of if it was like I would like to do a terrarium, could there be a kit that I could purchase and just Hello Cat? And just getting them delivered at once would be super convenient because no, it's not my favorite part of my day. Going out after work and then going to Home Depot and then finding out that I also have to go to Lowe's and then finding out that I also have to go to the other Home Depot. I'd rather not spend my time after school getting lab supplies, but that's just kind of how it works at my

And she's also the one who is much more familiar with, or she is not only more familiar, she literally has the catalogs and she's a younger person too, I would say she's in her mid thirties.

That'd be cool. Because I'm just learning that AI is just freaking amazing as of lately. But as far as I know, that's not necessarily a resource. It still comes down to, well, you're the expert, so what do you need? Go figure it out, kind of thing. And then I just assume at this point that most of my stuff is going to come from Carolina, because Carolina has a lot of the zoology things, that's kind of, again, their niche. They have the specimens, they have live specimens, they have models. That just seems to be their thing.

On there you could say, zoology kit 1 0 7, whatever, and I could get it that these two different places, but this one's cheaper. Or do you even have to get that detailed, or how do you do that?

Educator (42:06):

I feel like for my own personal level, I end up doing that and also making a note of what it is and what I would want it for. So I usually I would've it organized by aligned with my curriculum, so I have a general idea of what my curriculum's going to be.

I have been making informal lists. It's just like the way that our school is set up. We are currently doing course recommendations right now. So that's the main focus is just to see how many sections there's going to be and how it works. And then the budgety stuff that my boss, her brain hasn't switched next year yet. She's just starting finishing off this year and doing the course recommendations to end. She considers that part of this year, that process is part of this year. And then when we get back from break, that's when we'll really hit the ground running with textbook supplies, giving a tentative budget, how much different specimens might cost, and also any room updates if are necessary to make it so that it's a zoology classroom

A perfect world, I suppose. So let's say I was ordering a kit for a hydro lab, so I haven't ordered that yet. So it's a kit where we're getting live specimens of hydras and there's individual units. Ideally it would be something that I open up and everything. It's kind of like Ikea, e, where it's like here all the parts, they're labeled for every single group they need an A, B, A C, A D. That's what I'm doing. So as a science teacher, it's like I have these, and I think most teachers do this, but I have trays, they're little low trays and I fill it up with all the supplies kind of thing. And then those get distributed to all of my lab stations. But there is a core teacher station where I'm just like, okay, everyone gets a graduated cylinder, everyone gets a beaker, everyone gets this, and then it's right, it goes back out. So yeah, something that's a little bit more clear on that, I suppose."

I definitely have ordered kits before in the past where it's kind of just like, well, here's a giant bag of blank. I'm like, cool. How much per group? I have multiple classes. So what am I doing? How much am I giving them? Am I going to have enough flavor? Am Are you making me do math right now? Thank you so much. And ideally, as you're ordering it and being like, I'm going to have this overall, it'd be super great if the inventory was almost instead of units, it's like, this is how many lab groups I'm doing. That'd be kind of cool. Again, I think it'd be like most science classrooms. It's like either students are in pairs or in groups of three.

Guess it would just be in terms of a big wish. It would be cool if there was a website that just had a giant list of interesting labs. Just labs. Just labs, just a collection of labs. And they don't have to be super fancy, my God, they don't have to be super fancy. They really don't. But there are things that I can look at and be like, oh my God, I want to do that. I want my students to do that. And it's accessible because being a teacher too, part of it is me being human is like, do I have the time to also learn what that is and how that works? I would want it to be something where it's like, cool, I'm going to order one of those for me to try out for myself because I'm going to do it at least once for myself to try it out. Ideally, it's the exact same thing that the kids would have. And then what's like if I end up liking it, I'm able to order it in units of lab groups. That would be amazing. And then ultimately, as you were saying, if it came with worksheets and stuff, again, in my reality, I would probably take that worksheet and I'd make my own from it.

I mean, obviously I would appreciate quality. That makes sense. But I also actually, maybe I'm in the minority, but I actually prefer when there's a diversity of results because that's way more realistic of what real science is. I personally enjoyed the discussion of students being like, well, I didn't see that. And then a lot of the labs that we do, or at least that I did in high school, were fake labs. We were told that this is what's happening, but actually the teacher might've added baking. He had added secret little things to make the results happen the way that we wanted to.

I enjoy these. I feel like it's useful because, and in some way I will admit it feels a little bit arrogant, but it's like I feel like I'm a good teacher and it's just like what influence I can have to try to help other people be good teachers. And part of that is through resources and being able to communicate. That's part of the reason why I'm so involved with the social media is being able to communicate to someone being like, that's a great idea. Have you also considered just talking to the kids? Just little pedagogy tips that are Yes.

Yes. So that's good. And then Daylene or your gift card will come from Daylene and you'll have an option. It can be, you can do a Visa gift card or Target.
