No. I mean, basically to me they're just about the same. Just companies that just provide, I haven't had any, I wouldn't say good or bad, they provide what they say and you just go with it. Sometimes they become a default. Many times when I say, when we need, all of a sudden we need to order, you kind of sometimes end up just going with them because you have their catalog and because you have to hurry up and order or because you know the name.

But as far as some of the other ones, I'm trying to remember, do you remember Who did the mitosis one where you bought that one from? I feel the Mitosis one was actually one that we had here originally to begin with, but I think that we ended up having to order more and don't trying to remember where it came from. I'm digging through an email, emails right quick. I don't remember if that was from Flynn or if that was Wards. I think the pop bead ones we ended up, we did the pop beads with mitosis and then we also did it, we kind of sent the pop beads home for multiple little simulations and labs. So I feel like that it was a Flin box originally, but I could be wrong.","Daylene Long (20:38):

I know we did a mitosis lab and I think that that one was with the pop beads. Of course the pop beads, it's just counting out the certain numbers that they need.

86,sdoreyweb@wcboe.org,"I mean, for me, I'm pretty loyal to Flynn and that's just my go-to, and I think part of that is that's who, for the most part, the teachers that were here when I first started, those were their go-tos and it was just, oh, we can do one big collective order and save on shipping. And a lot of it's just who they had had, I don't want to say preference, but preference with before I started working here.","Daylene Long (44:20):

So kind of a legacy impairment. Yeah, basically. And is there anything that would make you, if everybody's ordering something from Flynn, is there anything that would make you really advocate for switching?

Sarah Webster (44:38):

I'll voice my opinion and maybe for me, I'm always trying to get the best deal for my money, so we'll just say if wards has something that if we buy it at a bigger quantity, but in the long run when we dish it out into smaller quantities that it's actually going to be cheaper. I sit down and look at the money. But I also, that's just my mentality of trying to make sure that I have enough to go through all year, but also trying to save and conserve and all that kind of stuff.","['Brand Perception', 'Buying Habits']",['Flinn Scientific'],44:20,"Sarah Dorey Webster Catapult-X Educator Interview - Dec 14, 2023.docx",R_2xPqCS7rFQBwAmu,Sarah,Dorey Webster,sdoreyweb@wcboe.org,1981-1996,James M Bennett Senior High School,Wicomico County Public Schools,Salisbury,MD,Science Teacher,"Life Sciences (e.g. Biology, Environmental, Anatomy & Physiology)","Biology,Anatomy and Physiology,Environmental Science","Flinn, Science world, Carolina",Current Vendor,Aware of (don't use),Current Vendor,Aware of (don't use),Aware of (don't use),Never heard of,Current Vendor,Current Vendor,Aware of (don't use),Current Vendor,Current Vendor,Current Vendor,"Carolina Biological,Wards/VWR","Discounts,Favorable terms for districts: up to 90 days",4-9 years,
