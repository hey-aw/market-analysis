Patrick McGee (25:32): Reliably? They have the cheaper prices. That's why a majority of the order was from Carolina. They also, in my experience, they're kind of off the shelf labs of blood typing lab and the micro electrolysis kit that I actually just recently used from them, they have pretty decent teaching materials, materialism. I adapted the micro electrolysis thing to kind of fit what I wanted it to do, but if I had to print it and give it to the kids, write out the book and I had no time, it probably would've been pretty effective too. And I know their blood typing labs got a similar kit. I know they have their catalyst lab to show yeast respiration and stuff like that. That's a pretty good one that I've seen before. Usually their microscope slides come with some kind of a kit and some kind of resource involved with it too. Their resources in that end and their kits are usually better. So I've been talking more and more to new teachers now that I've been in for a decade and they probably would be what I'd recommend just for the money.

But as far as the kids themselves, a couple of times you've had kids come where things were broken through, probably rough handling somewhere along the supply chain, but other than that, nothing really wrong with the kit themselves, just the way we get them sometimes, the way they're packaged with other things.","['Customer Experience', 'Environmental Sustainability']",[],16:16,"Mark Niebojeski Catapult-X Educator Interview - Dec 15, 2023.docx",R_2xFUGrkMClrjJk6,Mark,Niebojeski,markniebojeski@paps.net,1965-1980,Perth Amboy High School,Perth Amboy Public Schools,Perth Amboy,NJ,Science Teacher,"Life Sciences (e.g. Biology, Environmental, Anatomy & Physiology),Career & Technical Education (CTE)","Honors Biology,AP Environmental Science","Fisher,Carolina",Current Vendor,Current Vendor,Current Vendor,Never heard of,Current Vendor,Aware of (don't use),Current Vendor,Current Vendor,Never heard of,Aware of (don't use),Current Vendor,Current Vendor,"Carolina Biological,Fisher/Thermo Fisher Scientific","District approved vendor,Backed by research to improve student outcomes,Teacher Training: in-person workshops",Over 20 years,

Hi, this has been fantastic. I'm interested or would like to know what you could say in a couple of minutes about the school or your experience. I mean, you had a few years in a different school.

Janet Magargal (46:18):

In terms of,

Daylene Long (46:19):

It might be too broad, Kim, you might want to narrow that down, Kim.

Kimberly Herder (46:27):

Well, in ordering supplies or kits, or thinking about the student population there, what would you answer differently or how would you answer differently? Some of the questions that we've asked when you looked at ordering or funding or how you made those decisions, what you were going to use

Janet Magargal (46:49):

In the previous school, it would have to be bilingual. I taught 90% of students that could not speak English, so I would definitely need content differentiated. Even at the high school level, you would need things not only translated into a different language, but a huge need for scaffolded material, differentiated, adapted, just different forms of reading levels. So that would definitely be a huge difference. I mean, even in the current school, it would be nice to have options for differentiation. Some students do need things scaffolded a little differently, so that would be a huge time saver. I mean, I would be surprised if you would talk to an educator that doesn't have a diverse group of students, no matter where you are. I mean, they may physically look more similar in some settings than others, but there's always the academic need for structuring things differently, providing maybe a graphic organizer, sentence starters, and anything, I guess along those lines to aid in support. I mean, it's the whole concept of equity. What one student might need might look very different for another student to still share and have same concept.","['Digital Resources', 'Environmental Sustainability', 'Educational Policies']",[],46:49,"Janet Magargal Catapult-X Educator Interview - Dec 6, 2023.docx",R_3KIwB2pt9FRcdVW,Janet,Magargal,jmagargal@upperdarbysd.org,1965-1980,Upper Darby High School,Upper Darby School District,Drexel Hill,PA,Science Teacher,"Life Sciences (e.g. Biology, Environmental, Anatomy & Physiology)","Biology,AP Biology,Honors Biology","Carolina, bio rad",Current Vendor,Aware of (don't use),Aware of (don't use),Aware of (don't use),Aware of (don't use),Aware of (don't use),Current Vendor,Current Vendor,Aware of (don't use),Current Vendor,Aware of (don't use),Aware of (don't use),"Carolina Biological,Amazon","Backed by research to improve student outcomes,Free shipping (unlimited),Teacher Training: online webinars, videos, community support",Over 20 years,

And then lemme just flip through my notes just a little bit. Let's see, I'm just looking a little bit. How do you learn about new things you wanted to try? Let's talk about those skulls for a minute. Do you remember where you first learned about those? Neil McGovern (29:10): I honestly, the first time I saw those, I probably saw them in a catalog. So I'm a little bit of a self designer. I like to take activities and create little variations on 'em and redesign a little bit. I saw them in the catalog as part of a kit activity with supplies. And just in my head when I saw it, I knew exactly what I wanted to do with it. I knew I wanted to use an evolution. I knew I wanted to use it to create cladograms. And the procedure I like for Cladograms is I like to make kids take tape and put it on their table and actually position the living things at the end portions of the cladogram. And I knew I really wanted to start it with my honors biology classes and make them develop a procedure instead of using the procedure that comes with it, make them develop the procedure and the actual characteristics and measurements that they're going to use to determine that. And then from that point on with honors biology class, see how it went with them and then maybe move it in a form where they get a little bit, where they get more direction to be in some of the non-honor sections, they would need more direction on it where it's an honor. Daylene Long (30:24): Go ahead. So it wasn't something you were actually looking for. You're flipping through a catalog and you see it and the light goes on and that type of thing. Okay. Neil McGovern (30:34): Yeah, exactly. Daylene Long (30:35): And do you prefer the catalogs to the web or do you use both or? Neil McGovern (30:41): So I have to tell you, I love the paper catalog. Once again, the issue for us right now is we're doing our budget in October and we're not getting the new paper catalog until January, February, maybe something or maybe the end of the year. So it ends up being just on the web. For me, the problem with the web is everything's a search and it's so time consuming to do it that way and it's wards is probably the easiest, which is why, another reason I use them a lot, but it's just, it's time consuming. You type in the item you're looking for, you get 16 different choices, you have to click on that as well to see exactly which one is what you want. Whereas in the catalog, for example, with I know with Fisher and awards and catalogs, section glassware, these three pages beakers with a chart on it that says exactly this beaker made of this material in this measurement size, and for one, this is the cost next to it for a pack of 12, here's the cost.

nmcgovern@pmsd.org,I'm a pretty level guy. I'm delighted if they get me the stuff on time and it works well.,"Daylene Long (35:13): Good. So let's see what else. Really our goal today is to find out a little bit more about what you buy for the life sciences, how that experiences for you, how you make your decisions, and the ultimate goal is really to help our client to understand where it is that they can offer you value. We know that teachers are doing more time or doing more with less, and so we want to make sure that we're kind of poking around the edges for ideas of what would make the materials either better for you or better for your students. So that's kind of our ultimate, you're going to see that we ask a lot of what and why questions, and we're just trying to get into the whole experience that you have and if there's any frustration points or if there's any areas where you've just been delighted. We want to know those things and it helps a lot of educators to think of Kim and i's filming a documentary that we're kind of going back to when you first decided that you needed something for your classroom all the way through the end. So those are my basics. Neil McGovern (36:36): Yeah. Daylene Long (36:37): Any question about those before I dive in? Neil McGovern (36:40): No, I think I'm ready. Daylene Long (36:42): Okay. So tell me a little bit about the last time that you needed to purchase materials for any of your life sciences or bio or environmental classes. Neil McGovern (36:55): That would depend whether you're talking about school budget or me personally buying things out of pocket that we do quite a bit right now. Daylene Long (37:03): Let's talk about school budget because yeah, we could talk forever about, Neil McGovern (37:10): I'm sure. Yeah, Daylene Long (37:11): Yeah. Neil McGovern (37:11): So school budget, our school, what we do is we do budget. We basically just did it every October for the next school year right now. So we're actually really early compared to what we used to be When we budget, we budget for the classes, the schedule that we currently teach and it's assumed that if your schedule teaching that right now that applies. So basically the way that we do it is there are some materials that get budgeted that go into a bid process, general classroom wise, colored pencils, markers, things like that, things that are science specific. I usually have the ability to order through non-bid sources using one of our biological suppliers, whether it's ward order a lot from right now, a lot of what we use in class, what's critical, more easy to find on their site, easy to order.

So what I was imagining as you were talking, because you said sometimes it was hard to find them and you had to search, you had search that you would have by topic, like a hands-on kit for respiration along with a digital lab for respiration together. Neil McGovern (36:37): Once again, that's actually, it's great that you brought that up because that's what we're doing right now. So we're doing bioenergetics. So hands-on lab wise, we use right now what I use is I use the photosynthesis respiration activity that's in two parts and I like to vary activities a lot. I believe students need to be active, a very hands-on, very minds on type of teacher. Along with that, the resource that I use right now for interactive with photosynthesis, respirations actually excellent is the bio site that has games and virtual labs on it. So I dunno if you're familiar with that, but the bio site is, yeah, the bio site is excellent and his interactives, his little games is playing video games for the kids, his interactives with photosynthesis and respiration. There's no way you can't learn what it's taking in and letting out things like that just because win the game, you have to do that and the kids get so obsessed with winning the game, then you go back and you talk to 'em about, okay, so tell me, what did you have to do to get out of the mitochondrial matrix? Neil McGovern (37:05): Oh, we had to go through that pump, that a TP synthase pump when it turned and let us out. Okay. So what is that showing you in real life? What were you playing? Oh, I was this hydrogen ion and okay, so look at this. What did you just learn and oh, I see what I just did now I know I did that. So they worked together just really, really well. So many kids with so many different learning styles. You can't successfully be a teacher anymore that we had in high school where it was lecture all the time and things like that.

Because sometimes it's difficult for teachers to advocate for budgets because science is not going to be as cheap as social studies. Those are books. History hasn't changed, and those books are going to be a fixed cost, but eventually I'm going to need more fennel failing. And that's going to be something that is consistent. And so sometimes, and this is true with a lot of my friends in teaching across multiple districts, public and private charter schools, they don't understand that you can't just take your budget and divide it across departments. Like all departments are not created equal. And I feel that our society is moving towards STEM. That has been a 15-year-old shift. And so if we want to continue to have research for Covid and push for these things, we need to have children interested in bench based research. And if they don't have exposure to it at 15 and they have an attention span built on TikTok, they're not going to have the attention to solve cancer to find RNA. They're not going to be able to do it. So we really need to have the support here for those long-term changes.","Daylene Long (32:19):

We went around, the people in my department, we kind of split up and went around little groups and we're like, check that out, go over there and see what that's about. And they give you little promos, especially since ultimately the person who ends up putting the stamp of approval on a purchase is my department chair. And then she's the one who puts the ultimate stamp of approval. This is sciencey claim evidence reasoning is what we teach our kids. So claim, evidence, reasoning. I myself have to come up with claim evidence reasoning. If I wanted to make a big purchase, which I haven't had to do really much for my biology class, but my zoology class, I am making some larger purchases for and for that I need to create a claim evidence reasoning.

I just look for everything for inspiration. But as I'm probably filled out in the survey, I ultimately will end up taking that stuff and making it my own regardless. It's just, I suppose the way that I'm structured as a type A person, but it's like, oh, but I really need to make this specific for me and my kids. I need to put my own voice into it and getting ideas and maybe data and then being where I got a credit from kind of thing, but trying to synthesize things together I suppose.","Kimberly Herder (11:37): So what are some of those, if you'd share some of those websites or social media, where do you go and why do you trust them or do you trust them? Well, you must, if you go to them,

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (11:50): I trust them as a starting point. I trust them as maybe like an idea bank. Honestly, the Facebook groups have some of the most influential things, which is really cool. It's just seeing what other people are doing. I trust them in the sense that it's other biology teachers, they're doing things. I'm not naive to the fact that there are biology teachers who teach very boringly and quite plainly, but I am still able to get inspired by those things and then utilize that to try to construct my own thing, I suppose.",,General,11:37,"Greg Ruber Strohm Catapult-X Educator Interview - Dec 13, 2023.docx",R_11bIskMPuh55EKW,Gregory,Ruber,ruberg@eths202.org,1981-1996,Evanston Township High School,Evanston Township High School Dist 202,Evanston,IL,Science Teacher,"Life Sciences (e.g. Biology, Environmental, Anatomy & Physiology)","Biology,Honors Biology","Basic, thermofisher, ..Amazon ",Current Vendor,Current Vendor,Current Vendor,Aware of (don't use),Aware of (don't use),Aware of (don't use),Aware of (don't use),Aware of (don't use),Never heard of,Current Vendor,Current Vendor,Never heard of,"Carolina Biological,Amazon","District approved vendor,Free shipping (unlimited),Fast delivery (three days or less)",4-9 years,['Digital Resources']
