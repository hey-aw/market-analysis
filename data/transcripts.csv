Daylene Long (00:09):

Kim, Sean is ready to join us, so I'm going to go ahead and let him in. The other thing too is that if for some reason you are uncertain as to whether or not the recording will work on the one this afternoon, reschedule them. If you're confident that you can do it and record to cloud, then you're good. Okay?

Kimberly Herder (00:30):

Yep. So I'm

Daylene Long (00:31):

Going to have to leave after this call, but we might even try to take admit to test whether or not you can log into Zoom as me. Okay. Ready?

Kimberly Herder (00:45):

Yes. Hi, Sean Taylor? Yes. Hi, I'm Kim Herder and I'm with Daylene Long Catapult X. And hi, very glad that you're with us today and that you agreed to be part of this process, this interview, Daylene is the lead researcher on this project, and I'm going to ask you in a minute to tell us about yourself and your school. I'm going to jump off the screen and handle the technical side from the back, but I'll be present in Daylene. It'll be the one you're conversing during the interview.

Erin/Sean (01:44):

Okay?

Kimberly Herder (01:45):

Okay. So yes, please tell us about yourself.

Erin/Sean (01:48):

Okay. My name's Sean Taylor. I teach at Sierra High School. We're in San Bernardino, California. California, yeah, kind of a lower income, heavy Hispanic demographics. We're at a continuation high school, so our students are credit deficient when they come to us for various reasons. So our kids are typically with us for six weeks to try to catch up on credits as opposed to the normal 18. We've been focusing on our school a little bit more for skill development a lot, especially our science classes, and we're trying to push claim evidence and reasoning for the most part. I currently teach biology mostly, but I've been doing a little bit of coding, a little bit of forensic science from here and there, but our school offers physical science, health, environmental, and it changes from time to time, but that's typically what we do here, and I've been here since 2009.

Daylene Long (02:57):

Okay. Tell me how it works then if you've only have six weeks with these students, and I would imagine that, I'm assuming that they're not all credit deficient in the same areas or in the same learning skill sets. So how does that work?

Erin/Sean (03:18):

We kind of have a little bit of autonomy from our district, from our site admin to kind of go over essential standards for the most part. So we followed a little bit what the district's curriculum is, but we kind of came up with the other continuation that district kind of mapping out the essential skills and the essential standards and content we want the kids to reach. But we have a lot of flexibility where we're not necessarily following the textbook chapter one through 12. We pretty much can pick and choose what we want. We have six blocks throughout the year, and I'll do a part and B of a course three times throughout the year and every time it kind of changes for me personally just based on, hey, this worked, this didn't, or maybe I want to tackle a different format for the curriculum versus what I have been doing. We get kids who also repeat the class, unfortunately with us because attendance or work habits or whatnot. So I don't know if that's answering your question per se, but we follow a textbook, we follow the district pacing guide and kind of create our own, and we kind of collaborated with the auto continuation school.

Daylene Long (04:39):

Okay, that's really helpful. That helps me kind of understand what you're dealing with and that what I'm hearing is that you need to be maybe even more flexible than a lot of teachers who teach more traditional biology courses coming in and trying to really see where it is that they need skills.

Erin/Sean (05:02):

And at the end of the day, our school kind of has, I dunno, a vision graphic. It's not necessarily always academic based. I mean, our kids have a lot of gaps in all aspects of their lives.

Daylene Long (05:13):

So we've worked

Erin/Sean (05:14):

On mental, emotional and just building relationships I think is our number one priority I think with our kids, even before the content. And unfortunately no student probably gets same, does the same assignments for instance, or does this same curriculum for, I mean, I think we almost have to individualize what we give to each kid from time to time and unfortunately some don't find success with that or we don't find where we need to reach that kid specifically.

Daylene Long (05:48):

Yeah, yeah, really interesting. I skipped the part where I tell you kind of all of the overview stuff for that. So I'm going to go back to I was just fascinated with the way that your school works and really, I mean, you're teaching a very vulnerable population and that's really important, so thank you so much for doing that. But let me give you an overview of what we're doing today. So one, we are recording, but it's only for note taking purposes. You're not going to end up on YouTube, I won't ask you to do a TikTok dance, anything like that. So it's really just so I can get the notes. And our main goal is to kind of understand, and you're in a unique situation, how vendors can make it better for you as a teacher, better for students. What's missing out there? You'll have a chance, especially at the end, to kind of talk directly to the product development team and say, oh, I wish I had this or I wish I had that. And there've been a couple of people who have followed up afterwards in a few days where they're like, you know what? That was a really good opportunity, but I didn't have the chance to think about it. Now that I've thought about it, they'll send me an idea.

Daylene Long (07:13):

So you will see that we ask a lot of what, why and who questions. We're really trying to understand when you buy life science materials for your class, what that looks like for you. And we want to hear the stories of things that particularly delighted you, things that maybe disappointed you because we're trying to make it all better. There's no right or wrong answers, and for some educators it helps to think of Kim and I as filming a documentary and that's why we ask all the questions along the way. We want to get a full picture of the story for what's working, what's not working, and those kinds of things. That's my overview. You had mentioned in the survey part of this that you had bought materials for the life sciences in the last six months or so.

Erin/Sean (08:15):

Yeah, I'm department chair here, so we typically have the options. Let's buy, let's try something. Like I said, things don't work or the approach doesn't work with students. It's almost like, well, let's find better ways to buy more hands-on material with our kids. We don't have a lab here per se, so we're kind of limited with the safety aspect I should say,

Daylene Long (08:39):

In terms

Erin/Sean (08:40):

Of chemical disposal and safety things in place. But yeah, we pretty much purchased probably at least twice a year and I kind of have an autonomy to almost to whatever I want to be honest.

Daylene Long (08:54):

Okay. So twice a year, what months are those typically in?

Erin/Sean (09:01):

There really is no rhyme or reason. It's almost like, oh, I saw this or I, it usually happens when someone sends their product brochure and I go flip through it. I'm like, maybe we should try this. And I go, Hey, can I buy this? And I get glued and yeah. Do you

Daylene Long (09:19):

Get those product brochure in the mail or by email or how do you get those? They're

Erin/Sean (09:23):

Usually sent to the site and they just throw it in my box. They're

Daylene Long (09:28):

Usually sent to the science department or something like that. And they put it in your box?

Erin/Sean (09:33):

Yeah.

Daylene Long (09:34):

Okay. And what are the kinds of things that have been catching your eye lately then when those flyers come in? And I will also ask too, is there a particular time of year that you like getting those? I

Erin/Sean (09:49):

Would probably say the beginning of the school year and the beginning of January and then that July august time, just so you order it and get it for the year for the most part. Sometimes it's at the end of the year because they have to spend the money or it goes away. So usually that's also good the end of the school

Daylene Long (10:12):

Year

Erin/Sean (10:12):

Because they're like, oh wait, we have money, we have to spend it. So you kind of have a little bit more. Yeah, it's like a budget thing.

Daylene Long (10:19):

Okay. So think back then a little bit to the last order that you placed. What kind of prompted your desire to buy it and then who did you buy from? Tell me just kind of the story of the last purchase you made.

Erin/Sean (10:36):

Okay. We went to the NSTA conference in Atlanta, when was it? March, April. So you get to see the vendors, get to participate in some of their breakout rooms. So there was a lot of things I saw there, especially with PCR and DNA technology, I personally enjoy that and I see a lot of value for the students to learn it and

Daylene Long (11:01):

See

Erin/Sean (11:01):

How it works in the real world with disease and things. We're actually doing same thing too. The COVID had a lot of information at that conference just going into the, so we were trying to look at buying many PCR machines. So the one that stepped out was mini PCR. So I talked to the vendor and told her about our school and our students and their needs and purchased a couple of their machines of their PCR machines, their DNA fingerprinted machines, couple of their lab kits.

Erin/Sean (11:39):

And again, my intention was to try to get kids some skill. I can pipette or I can test my own DNA because our students at the end of the day, their motivation level is ground zero unfortunately, especially with science, whether it's academic or motivation or what's this have to do with me, why do I need to learn about population graphs and DNA structure, things that we teach. So I was almost thinking this is a real world happening day going into crispr, going into real world technology with the science for learning that will and is affecting their lives today. So that's why I went with that mini PCR to start. Has

Daylene Long (12:28):

It really connected to their lives?

Erin/Sean (12:31):

I feel like it's modern application of the science we're learning as opposed to our kids are very trained into copy a textbook, Google an answer, and we want to try to teach kids a little bit more of being curious and problem solving. And at the end of the day, that's what I think science is at the end of the days, being curious about the world around you and finding some way to have kids curious about the world around them is I think my number one goal as opposed to you can recite facts out of a textbook. We have AI to do that now. We have Google to do that now. I mean we need thinkers not So I'd say that was the last purchase, kind of a big one. And then I've been flipping through just some catalogs recently just to go, Hey, because halfway through the school year now, so this is our last day before winter break and starting a new school, kind of a new block second half of the year, I want to find this didn't work, this approach was not good. I need to be more hands-on. So that's why I was kind of flipping through. But one I got recently from NASCO because I haven't really been liking the ones I have been purchasing prior to

Daylene Long (13:48):

These

Erin/Sean (13:49):

Kit.

Daylene Long (13:51):

And what were you purchasing prior to it that you didn't really like? I

Erin/Sean (13:56):

Think I've been doing a lot of flin just because easy and I feel like nothing quite meets what I'm teaching specifically. I don't feel like what they offer is necessarily following the NGSS or following the standards especially. I think my kids need a lot more background knowledge before some of the, so I've never really been, we have big topics for our classes. I don't think there's nothing really directly meeting those topics, which is weird to me. I feel like the textbooks are all kind of follow that same model of the Living Earth model. For biology specifically,

Daylene Long (14:41):

What are some of those big topics that you're wanting to teach that you're not necessarily finding kids for?

Erin/Sean (14:47):

Alright, for instance, we do a lot with population caring capacity. I don't think I've found anything on caring capacity anywhere that's really valuable

Daylene Long (14:59):

Capacity.

Erin/Sean (15:01):

I'm sorry,

Daylene Long (15:02):

On what kind of capacity?

Erin/Sean (15:04):

Carrying capacity like maximum ecosystem can support what causes populations to rise and fall, predator parade relationships, resource management. So I try to introduce that topic with like, Hey, is the earth going to hit? Are we overpopulated as people? Are we going to have resource management issues? So there's a lot of graphing involved with that and I think that's a big topic for the ecology portion of our course for Bio A is this idea of carrying capacity building models, representing that which is not good for students, a not of graphing, and what does that graph mean? So I'd say that's a big topic. I'm not really finding anything very useful for, we try to do energy movement through ecosystems like food webs. And I know my roommate, we have an A m PMM session, so I have a roommate, he teaches environmental science, so he does a little bit of that as well. I would even say the DNA model stuff is not really, I never really found anything that's quite, here's the base pairing rules. How does this produce a protein? How does this protein, what does this protein even mean? How does this, even the genetic stuff, I don't really find anything. Something simple like a pun a square. I mean,

Daylene Long (16:34):

Okay, you're not finding the kits, which it sounds like that's why you were happy at the PCR of the mini PCR.

Erin/Sean (16:41):

Well, and I would say the mini PCR is great, but I still need to get the kids to the place where they understand what they're doing, what that machine's doing. How does this band show that you can taste, one of 'em is tasting PTC paper, which he can physically figure out, but how does this band from the DNA show that you can actually taste? So I'm hoping to get my kids, even the PCR is almost like the final project and I got to get the filler to get the kids to that final project.

Daylene Long (17:19):

Okay. So it sounds to me like you're saying with the population that you're serving that even getting kids interested enough to be able to learn this means applying it to their world, applying it to what something that matters to them has been important to you?

Erin/Sean (17:39):

I would say so, but I think again, a lot of our kids, it's all over the place. It's attendance, it's motivation. Some of 'em lower reading level, lower English proficiency, some of 'em have a lot of gaps in their education where we're teaching high school material, but I sometimes have to drop back to sixth and seventh grade standards. Sometimes I just, because where they're at and attendance and whatnot. But I think just something very accessible where they feel they could do it and kind of build that confidence as well is often an issue. And I would say for me, I'm, I don't say difficult as a teacher, but I think I set the bar a little bit higher than some of my other colleagues here, which is almost giving credits away I want to say, which I kind of hate. I want my kids to leave here with something valuable as opposed to I just passed a class, you actually got something, learn something, gain something, but something accessible and something that maybe they, and you get that from every kid in every classroom. Why do I need to learn this? What's the point of this? Where for me, learning is enough, being educated is enough for some, it's unfortunately not even earning the grade is sometimes not with our kids, but just finding that spark, that curiosity I think would be the number one for these kids.

Daylene Long (19:17):

Sparks and curiosities. Okay, that makes a lot of sense. And it also sounds like you need flexibility in how you teach topics. Oh yeah. I

Erin/Sean (19:27):

Would say some of our kids are great. Why are you even here? And you could probably guess probably is more personal than academic. So you have kids that are kind of at the top of the scale and you got kids really at and trying to find that middle ground, especially on the day-to-day. I mean that's a big issue I think I have daily here at work is just some kids I can go do the high level. Most of 'em are in the middle and then some of 'em are just,

Daylene Long (20:06):

Okay. Okay, that makes sense. I'm flipping through my notes to see. Okay. So the stuff you bought from mini PCR, have you received it already?

Erin/Sean (20:20):

Oh Yeah.

Daylene Long (20:21):

Okay. And what was that experience like? Were you happy with what you got? Have you tried it out, that type of thing?

Erin/Sean (20:30):

Yeah, I was happy with what I got. Used it during summer school, used it last block because it's more the second half of biology, which I only done once, so I had to be using it again in January. But like I said, I ran into that issue of that's, you need a lot more inform background. You don't just go, here's the PCR and this is it. You got to get that genetics portion, you got to get that punnet square portion, you got to get the DNA structure in first. But no, the ordering process was good. I had meetings with the vendor and kind of walked, this is what I recommend you get came in pretty quick. I didn't expect to get it when I got it. I also ordered, I don't know if software kind of matters.

Daylene Long (21:28):

Yeah, I'd love to hear about that.

Erin/Sean (21:31):

I've tried many because virtual labs, and again, what is offered out there is not very, does not meet the standards. I don't know to really, doesn't mean what we're teaching at all at all. But we did. So what was that called? There was a virtual lab order last year that we used and we kind of, no, not this year. Do

Daylene Long (21:58):

You remember who did it? Who made that

Erin/Sean (22:00):

Shoot? I want to say they're out of Boston. I cannot tell you.

Daylene Long (22:08):

That's Okay.

Erin/Sean (22:09):

Unfortunately it was that forgettable, I mean, I hate to say it, but

Daylene Long (22:16):

So

Erin/Sean (22:17):

I ordered software through a company called Cognitive,

Erin/Sean (22:23):

Which again, they have a framework for what I would love to get. But again, like I said, does not exactly meet what we're teaching the kids, which is kind of a little frustrating a little bit. So I've been trying to see how the kids engage with that a little bit more though it kind of gives a little bit of a hybrid online portion go out and do something portion. So I'm trying to find a good way to integrate that with what I typically do. And even next, I'm trying to open science education curriculum that they give out for free

Daylene Long (23:07):

Opens.

Erin/Sean (23:09):

Yeah, I found some of their stuff that I'm going to probably look over during winter break and see, hey, can I take bits and pieces of this? But that big, I'm sorry, I'm

Daylene Long (23:21):

Sorry. Do you remember with open SED that, are there lamps and experiments as part of that? I'm

Erin/Sean (23:30):

Fishing through it. I think they have a materials list and I think they have more simulations from what I'm gathering,

Erin/Sean (23:39):

Which I'll be honest with you, our students, the hands-on stuff, It's just find the right hands out and stuff from the, we had somebody come in from somewhere in the county and they were about gardening and they brought in composting worms. The kids enjoyed it and then, alright, that's cool. The hands on the enjoyment part, the memorable part because that's what got me into science I think as a kid, is remembering the stupid things my teacher did in high school. I don't think I'm doing that as a teacher personally where I'm at in terms of something memorable that 20 years from now, I remember my teacher did this, but the earthworm thing would be one of 'em, the composting, the Verma culture. But the only thing missing there was, alright, well what did they learn at the end of the day besides we played with worms, what did they actually learn?

Daylene Long (24:40):

Yeah, did you have that tied to a standard Or

Erin/Sean (24:43):

Oh no, they just kind of came in because someone in the school made this connection. They offered to come in. So there really wasn't, luckily it was kind of meeting where we're learning about food webs and energy roles with producers, consumers, decomposers. So I did kind of make that connection. And again, it's making that connection to like, hey, this stuff we're learning, it's the world you live in because our kids are very just isolated. Many of 'em don't leave their city or leave their phone sometimes. It's like you're part of this world, what's happening here is part of this. Your food costs, your gas costs, your food, your housing costs, it all ties even into the biology we're learning and just trying to get that spark going again. That's been my number one why I feel like I failed daily sometimes is I want every kid to be like, yeah, yeah,

Daylene Long (25:45):

You make a really good point about the disconnect with kids because sometimes they just don't even leave their phone. And I was thinking about the earthworm things that you were doing and it sounds like it's important to know what the standards are going in for you as a teacher, but also to know how that relates to a student's world in a bigger picture to really try and connect to things that they care about and things that are important to them. Yeah, That's true. Okay, that makes sense. I'm flipping through my notes. Do you guys do any dissections?

Erin/Sean (26:32):

We do not. Again, the safety aspect, we don't really have a lab and there's the legalities of the safety and a contract signed from parents for science safety is hit and miss too. And then I personally don't really find a standard in biology that I teach that would require it unless we really got into spend a lot more time on body systems and homeostasis. But we kind of body systems and homeostasis move on because again, we don't have a lot of time with our kids.

Daylene Long (27:13):

And

Erin/Sean (27:13):

Then attendance too. I'm a lot of kids missing it. They don't get a chance to dissect moving on to the next. So I've never done dissections at all since I've been here.

Daylene Long (27:27):

What about anything with, well you mentioned the worms, but anything with live specimens or plants or animals or invertebrates or anything like that?

Erin/Sean (27:42):

I got a hydroponics garden started, tried it again. The student buy-in probably might've been my problem or I didn't give 'em enough chance to buy-in. So I kind of want to get into more, not just the hydroponics but the hydroponics with the goldfish and the fish cycling the nutrients and materials a little bit more just to kind of show that it does tie into what we teach carbon cycling. But no, we have the worms here now. But no, we really haven't dealt with live specimens per se. Something I'm open to and thinking about a little bit more. Even something like, oh, a little class pet, I just don't want to take care of it. I bought a litter robot for the fiance. I don't want to do anything with glitters. Aren't feeding nothing.

Daylene Long (28:39):

Yeah, I hear you. So a couple of just things that I was thinking about. You mentioned two things. You mentioned building their self-esteem and their confidence level in learning as being important. And also why the heck am I learning this is really important with the populations that you're serving, those two things.

Erin/Sean (29:10):

Oh yeah, for sure.

Daylene Long (29:12):

So any materials that you can think of or that you've used in the past that have helped with that

Erin/Sean (29:19):

All? Unfortunately, this doesn't tie into the content I'm teaching, but like a coding kit where you're actually plugging into computers and creating a code that actually produces, when we got trained on it, we just did an in service and I was like, I want to buy this and see how it works. We to build a parade float so there's gears and colors. And so I remember taking a few students aside to do that. I remember ordering with a grant just randomly and a circuits kit and the kids just, some kids were just playing with it. They had nothing to do. And actually my roommate had the kids to do that, so I actually observed them using something I bought and never used. And kids seem to have enjoyment there. I think life science, again is one of those kind a difficult ones to, because we have kids quick, we have 'em short period of time. It's kind of hard to find that even growing plants, I remember I'm talking all over the place, I can keep my

Daylene Long (30:34):

A great job, you really,

Erin/Sean (30:37):

But my brain's going 20 different areas. What's wrong with me? I got to have a straight going over Wisconsin, those flowers for DNA genetics, I don't have time to plant this. And then

Daylene Long (30:51):

That are quick,

Erin/Sean (30:52):

The luxury of that time. And I feel like life science materials kind of needs a lot of time. If I'm going to grow a plant, I don't have, this plant might not even grow in six weeks.

Daylene Long (31:07):

And that's a good point too for our client to think about is for these kind of shorter labs, how long would you want them to be?

Erin/Sean (31:19):

I would probably say one to two class periods. So maybe two hours, three hours.

Daylene Long (31:26):

Okay. Broken up into distinct chunks of what

Erin/Sean (31:31):

I would say chunks of content-based chunks a little bit,

Daylene Long (31:37):

Not content, but the experiment itself or the hands-on activity itself. If you're doing it over a couple of days, how much should the activity take in your time?

Erin/Sean (31:51):

Alright, well here's ideally kids are able to design, collect data, interpret that data, and we've kind of been working on that claim evidence reasoning approach, a DI approach, which is another vendor we kind of worked with in the district at some point.

Daylene Long (32:08):

When is that that you work with on the CER?

Erin/Sean (32:12):

It was years ago. I don't know if we're still working with them. It was argument driven inquiry, I want to say

Erin/Sean (32:19):

Where you have an essential question and then kids design an experiment and collect data and ideally that's what we want our kids to get. That's a skill we want myself and my colleagues in the science department. But these kids struggle with that independent idea. The independent, they want a right answer to just point to it and give it to me as opposed to there is no right answer. What does that data mean to you? I forgot what top brought this up. But that's the number one skill I want these kids to have. Collect data, provide the evidence, back up the evidence. What does that data mean? That's ideal. But a kid that gives the kids some background knowledge, maybe here's a way to collect data, here's a way to express that data. Now what does this mean?

Daylene Long (33:17):

Okay. So you really trying to teach them how to think critically and not just know the facts, but how to understand giving them a framework to understand the world

Erin/Sean (33:31):

And the application of the world. And

Erin/Sean (33:34):

Again, interpreting data. Again, our school's trying to focus on mental emotional health a lot, but also just those transferable skills. And I fail to recognize even as a teacher sometimes that when I'm teaching these kids, they unfortunately aren't going to do anything with when they leave here. And besides maybe just, oh, I remember learning that as opposed to, Hey, is there a skill they can take with us if they don't go to college, they don't go to school. Hey, you need to learn how to interpret data. You need to know how to be curious about why something. So I think that's the number one thing is, I don't know

Daylene Long (34:20):

When you were talking about that, I don't have a question so much as a comment and then I'll come back. But they might surprise you in how they end up using those things because even when you vote, you need to be able to understand claim evidence and reasoning to make a decision as to whether or not that data is valid. So it becomes just, or when you go to the doctor and they make a recommendation and you have to decide whether or not you get a second one. So I only bring that up because you said you weren't sure if they're ever going to use it, but I think that

Erin/Sean (35:04):

Well, they're going to, they don't know. They don't understand. There

Daylene Long (35:08):

We go.

Erin/Sean (35:09):

And I'll throw this even back a little bit more to my kids don't talk, my students don't talk, they don't say nothing and we want to push the group the talk they're sharing the working together and the strategies to do that within a lab setting or a hands-on setting would be awesome as well. But in the kids' feedback, I daily kind of feel like I fail at my job honestly. Because you see a group, it's almost like just stoic. And I don't really realize that they're learning until the work they turn in, obviously, but they give a little survey at the end of the block and they're like, oh, I learned a lot. This is good class. But they don't give that any sort of I care, I'm learning, I'm understanding. And part of that's my fault, don't get me wrong, but turning on that engagement where you see it in their eyes and their face.

Daylene Long (36:09):

Yeah. Yeah. There's so many things I could say about that, but I don't want to get distracted and I want to be respectful of our time. You guys are incorporating a lot of social emotional into it, which I think is awesome. So I'm hearing a lot of that. And do you have any vendors that you would consider yourself loyal to?

Erin/Sean (36:36):

I thought I was very loyal to Flynn, but I'm kind of open. When I started here, I went with Carolina. I want to say

Daylene Long (36:46):

I

Erin/Sean (36:46):

Don't think I gotten anything from them since I, and I don't think I really use, and again, I ran the same conundrum. I'm spending a lot of money, but not really using it.

Daylene Long (36:55):

Okay. Why weren't you using the Carolina stuff, if you were buying things? This

Erin/Sean (37:00):

Was a long time ago, to be honest. I would say back when I started, I got order through Carolina. But I would venture to say it goes back to how does this directly tie into what we're learning or this essential standard or skill we're focused on. I would say that, and maybe I'm reading into these things wrong, but we have the books and we use it as a framework of the content. And I feel like everyone's not quite meeting, Hey, this is the content that's in the Living Earth model. For instance, going on right now with biology, tying in the earth science to physical sciences with the biology. I don't know, I feel like everything's still standards based. Back in the nineties when I was in high school,

Daylene Long (37:57):

You called it living earth concept. Is that what it was? Yeah. So not being a teacher, I haven't heard of that, but is that based around some of the environmentalism and oh, what do you call it? All right, I'm blanking. The climate change issues

Erin/Sean (38:27):

That would tie into it a little bit. And they try to get a little bit more of, it's trying to tie in all physical and environmental with it as well. And it's a different model than the old standards based. Even when I was in high school, you learn about cells, you learn about tissue, then you move on. The way the books are set up and the way the curriculum is set up, you start with ecosystems and populations first, and then you move into carbon cycling and photosynthesis, respiration things. Then you move into evolution and then you move into genetics and DNA and then into eventually ends up with climate change. So that's kind of like the way the books are organized now these days. And because we just got a new, I guess a fairly new textbook adoption and our continuation site went with a different book versus the comprehensive and all the books still fall. That kind of, that pace, that guideline in order.

Daylene Long (39:36):

Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. So you don't use Carolina anymore. And you said that was way back when you first started. When did you first start teaching?

Erin/Sean (39:46):

2009. Okay.

Daylene Long (39:50):

You said you No, I'm open to anything.

Erin/Sean (39:54):

I'm not loyal to anyone. I'll give booklets and I'll just skim through 'em. Oh, that's cool. That's good. That's good. I would go to Carolina. No problem. If I saw something that You

Daylene Long (40:11):

Said though that you used to be, felt like you used to be loyal to Flynn, but not so much anymore. I think

Erin/Sean (40:17):

That was just my, it was the easiest vendor to deal with and work with and get approval and what my stite needs to from them. And I think that even goes back to ease of, because unfortunately there's so many levels and layers or purchasing, it starts from us, the teacher, then it goes to the admin, then it goes to the purchaser on site, then it goes to 55 district people, and then it finally gets mailed to a warehouse and then maybe it gets you. So that's also sometimes part of the process as well is dealing with the layers of point A to point B. That's what we need. But

Daylene Long (41:04):

You said that Flynn used to be really easy to work with. What made them easy to work with and what made you think, okay, maybe I'm not as loyal to them? I

Erin/Sean (41:17):

Would say just go on the website, searching up a topic, finding what's there, finding the code, making a shopping cart. I think that's kind of mostly the approach I've been taking. Unfortunately, because I don't have a budget to work with, it's almost, it would be nice to say, Hey, you got this much money to spend, go spend it. As opposed to, oh, I'm just going to randomly one day just go, let me see in order that way. And I think that would help if these vendors would also almost break it down by the standards or the content. And we're like, here's a bunch of, it's very like, oh, this is physical, this is earth, this is bio, this is microscopes, this is dissection. Which a little bit more like this is about ecosystems and populations and this is about DNA and genetics, and this is about, then I ease up the ordering process and finding what you want, what you need.

Daylene Long (42:22):

So you're seeing that vendors are dividing things up according to what they have, whereas what you would like to see is here are all the resources you could use for populations. Here are all the resources you could maybe use to teach ecosystems or genetics or those kinds of things.

Erin/Sean (42:47):

And I would say maybe tying it into an NGSS standard more specifically to A-N-G-S-S standard,

Daylene Long (42:58):

Even in the ordering process when you're searching maybe. Okay, the DCIS or the Cross-cutting concepts and science and engineering practices or all of those.

Erin/Sean (43:10):

I would say all of those, but specifically the NGSS, which is build a model that shows,

Daylene Long (43:19):

Okay,

Erin/Sean (43:21):

This NASCO one right now, and it'll say health sciences, it'll say sales, but I'm finding a lot of stuff we don't even teach anymore. Don't go do osmosis diffusion. We don't do even cell structure anymore, especially let's now assume they learned it in middle school.

Daylene Long (43:40):

Yeah. Okay. I want to be respectful of time and we've just got a couple minutes left, so I want to ask Kimberly to come back in and join us and see if she has any questions.

Kimberly Herder (43:58):

I don't know that I have any questions because I feel a bit overwhelmed. What you do is amazing and that the population that you serve is deserving and you are filling that role. And I am humbled. And a couple times during this, I was glad I wasn't on camera because I was tearing up, so I don't have any questions, but except that you are doing amazing things. Yeah,

Daylene Long (44:44):

We really appreciate the work that you're doing. I felt the same way, but I had to keep focused on the questions. So I want to thank you for everything you do for students and for other teachers as well. Kim, do you want to give Sean next steps because we've just got a few minutes left and I want to be respectful of his time.

Kimberly Herder (45:08):

So this afternoon you'll get an email from me. And besides it being a huge heartfelt thank you, it'll ask a couple different things. One, if you do think of something this afternoon, this weekend, next week, this next month that you would like to pass on to us, that we can go directly to where that needs to go to, we will do that. And then also an invitation. We'd very much like you if you'd be available to do something like this. Again, that because your opinion matters and what you experience matters, and we'd like to put you on our friends list.

Daylene Long (45:57):

Yeah, definitely. At the end of the day, after we finish all of the interviews, when I typically will send out your gift card, you'll get a choice of a Visa gift card or a Target gift card, or I think you can even do all of it on Starbucks if you really want to. So you've got quite a few choices in there. And let's see, you're on West Coast time with us, so it'll probably be early this evening. Before you get that,

Erin/Sean (46:28):

Appreciate that.

Daylene Long (46:32):

And again, thank you for all that you do, and we look forward to staying in touch with you. We definitely consider you part of our community now. So feel free to reach out whenever you'd like.

Erin/Sean (46:45):

Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Thank

Daylene Long (46:47):

You. Bye-Bye.

Erin/Sean (46:48):

Have a nice holiday. Thanks,

Daylene Long (46:50):

You

Kimberly Herder (46:50):

Too.

Erin/Sean (46:51):

Bye.

Daylene Long (46:53):

Kim, would you stay on for just a second?

Daylene Long (00:03):

So tell us who we are meeting with this morning.

Kimberly Herder (00:06):

We are meeting Sarah Dory Webster and I can actually tell you that she was born in 93, so this makes her about to have her 30th birthday, I don't know when or has just turned 30. She's been teaching for seven years. She teaches biology at James Bennett Senior High School in Maryland, in Salisbury, Maryland. From what I mean, her little bit of comments and what she also confirmed what she put on the survey was that assessments, assessments are really important to her or her school, I don't know, but consumables, discounts and financing, which she's the only one who has said anything about financing for her district. They do have, oh sorry, Can you pause for a minute and tell me again what school, what state, what

Daylene Long (01:00):

City?

Kimberly Herder (01:01):

James Bennett Senior High School in Salisbury, Maryland.

Daylene Long (01:06):

Okay, thank you. Sorry, I'm caffeinating even while you speak.

Kimberly Herder (01:11):

Sure. And there's four high schools in their district, this being one of 'em. And then there is another high school that is strictly CTE, but I couldn't find out if kids just go over there from the other three home schools or, anyway, she is, yeah, like I said, she is on the committee to review view curriculum and science curriculum. She sells Pampered Chef and she does DIY videos on YouTube and Facebook for everything from building stuff to, I mean it's like everything she does, she seems to make a video about it on how to do it, do it.

Daylene Long (02:01):

So does she do it for biology as well? Did she do it for classes or just

Kimberly Herder (02:05):

That? I couldn't find, but actually I didn't get that far in it. I was actually, but it's everything from building a campfire to building a fireplace outside and then she does and then repairing her sink and Those. Wow.

Daylene Long (02:24):

She's super interesting

Kimberly Herder (02:27):

And well 30 years old and looks like her first house. But anyway, that kind of thing. So that's what I know of her.

Daylene Long (02:35):

What year did you say she was born? In

Kimberly Herder (02:37):

93.

Daylene Long (02:39):

Okay. I think she's a young millennial because my nieces were born in 1999 and they are Gen Z. So you said 93.

Kimberly Herder (03:02):

So

Daylene Long (03:02):

She is on the younger side of the millennials with bordering onto Gen Z, so that's good. I don't think we've talked with somebody in that age bracket.

Kimberly Herder (03:17):

No. Well last night, Gregory, the one that I did, Gregory, Was he a millennial as well? Yeah. Or would that be Gen Z? Whatever it is that he's 27.

Daylene Long (03:29):

He's 27. Okay. So then he would be, okay, my morning math.

Kimberly Herder (03:39):

Yeah, I can it backwards

Daylene Long (03:42):

27, so he might be Gen Z 97 is the beginning of Gen Z and that would put someone at 13. Yeah, he's Gen Z. That's awesome. It's good to have different representatives of different age groups in there, so that's good. He was interesting too, especially with the, okay Kat get away where he was talking to. So actually he was talking to his bearded dragon and did he have a dog in there?

Kimberly Herder (04:36):

No, two cats and the bearded dragon and something else, but at least there was no reference to a dog.

Daylene Long (04:44):

So it must've been the cats I heard him talking to from time to time. That was funny. And he seemed very enthusiastic about being a biology teacher

Kimberly Herder (04:58):

And a couple of times he's like, kits, man, I should be looking that that's kind of like brilliant or whatever. I just go out and get whatever I need, but wow. A kit. And he goes, how come I haven't heard anything about these or that kind of thing. So that made me think. Okay. Alright, so perhaps target marketing those new teachers. That's a really good idea, cam, that I can wrap up in this part of the synopsis

Daylene Long (05:34):

For the young. Yeah, that's a really good idea.

Kimberly Herder (05:39):

The other thing that, well we can talk about, I dunno if it's recording, but when I was working with Weston and when Weston was, it was Ritz Carlton and Weston was pretty much the places to stay. We were taught instructed you don't

Daylene Long (06:00):

Discount Kim cutting out a little bit.

Kimberly Herder (06:03):

Oh, you don't discount things when you are the best at something or close to the best. You don't discount your product, you add value in other ways. So it would be, it's better to give away a room night than discount it by 20%

Daylene Long (06:21):

Because you end up in a race to the bottom where it becomes a commodity.

Kimberly Herder (06:27):

And

Daylene Long (06:27):

We're seeing a bit of that with teachers where they're like, it's price. But I would counter that with it's what's the added value that we can add onto this so that it's not just price.

Kimberly Herder (06:45):

And

Daylene Long (06:46):

Maybe what kind of popped into my mind too is maybe even a comparison sheet where there's, they're doing side-by-side analysis, but what if we gave them a tool to do side-by-side analysis that also had some of the extra benefits that our client brings to the table for it.

Kimberly Herder (07:07):

And it is, but part of them is to understand being new at it that they don't even understand the benefit. I mean that benefit might not be important to them yet.

Daylene Long (07:19):

Yeah. Well, and to me this is clear, was this his first job with Greg yesterday?

Kimberly Herder (07:28):

His first, he had been a education educator at a different high school until he had his certification. So he called it, he's a dropout PhD. I don't know if you heard that. He was in his PhD program and decided that at U Chicago that it was too business driven and he just, the research head and those important parts that he felt in the research he was doing was becoming too profit or motivated that way and he had to step away.

Daylene Long (08:04):

All the world's a business at least in the us So it's good that he figured that out because it is the underpinning of everything

Kimberly Herder (08:19):

In

Daylene Long (08:19):

The us.

Kimberly Herder (08:20):

Somebody's got to pay for it,

Daylene Long (08:23):

Somebody has to pay for it. And even the nonprofits out there, they're doing really good work and science education, they're being either funded by the government, so tax dollars or they're being funded like HHMI where it's a nonprofit that's based on capital that's in the bank accruing interest and investments and stuff. So yeah. What time is it? It's 8 0 5. I think sending her an email or text or whatever would be good. I really want to let you out. Rotten Cat, come on. My little insubordinate. I Come on. Yeah, you're like, no, I'm totally staying here, mom. This cat that we have right now is the sweetest cat. I'm going to pause. I've never done that before. Play. Okay.

Kimberly Herder (10:06):

Sarah? Yes. Sorry. Hi. Meeting

Sarah Webster (10:09):

For a virtual class that I teach.

Kimberly Herder (10:13):

Oh cool. Well we'll probably want to hear that too, but I'm having a difficult time hearing you, so I don't know if you need to get a little closer to the mic. Well, yeah, that will handle it right there.

Sarah Webster (10:33):

Is that better?

Kimberly Herder (10:34):

Oh my goodness. Fantastic.

Daylene Long (10:36):

Much better. Thank you.

Kimberly Herder (10:37):

Well, it's still morning for us, but you're getting towards the lunchtime part, so thank you for being with us. I'm Kim Herder and I'm with Daylene Long and she's the lead researcher for this project and we're very excited for you to be here, happy that you're here and what you're going to say and your thoughts are important to us and to the client. So I am going to in a minute, step off camera and do the technical behind the scenes part and then pop back in later. But if you can start with just telling us about yourself for a minute and how you got to what you're doing and what you're teaching, all those things.

Sarah Webster (11:22):

So this is year eight for me. I am originally an agriculture education teacher,

Sarah Webster (11:30):

But there were no positions open in my area when I was applying. So I started out teaching biology. I then moved to teaching bio and earth and space. Then our school did away with earth and space. So then I picked up environmental and I had been teaching biology and environmental science ever since. This year I was moved to part-time in-person teaching part-time virtual teaching. Our county has implemented a new behavioral program that these kids are in a in-school suspension setting. And so we have to teach everything to them virtually. So they're sitting in a room, they're zooming into me sitting in my office teaching. So this has been a whole year of change.

Daylene Long (12:22):

Wow. The program that you're talking about with the in class suspension is really interesting. Do you know of other schools that do that or is this something that is new for you guys?

Sarah Webster (12:35):

This is completely new to us. We have an alternative school as well. So this is kind of how it was explained to us is the teachers. It's a pre-step to going to that long-term term

Daylene Long (12:52):

Kind of a pilot Maybe?

Sarah Webster (12:53):

Yeah, I mean we're definitely piloting it the first and the classes change every four and a half weeks. So we get a whole new group of kids at the middle of a marking term and then a whole new group of kids at the end of the marking term going into the next marking term. So every four and a half weeks my kids change.

Daylene Long (13:16):

So I would imagine that's a challenge. Yes. Yeah. I intend to start here, but I would love to know how it is. How do you do hands-on labs then with them if they're remote or is that not? So

Sarah Webster (13:36):

The hands-on labs, a lot of it I have had to tailor them to items that they're going to have at home or things that are honestly cheap and disposable that our school can send, put little lab kits together and send to them. And so it definitely takes a lot of preparation on my part is figuring out what I'm going to do, what those hands-on labs that I'm going to do during that four and a half weeks are so that their lab kits are ready at the beginning of that four and a half weeks.

Daylene Long (14:17):

Yeah, that's really interesting. I skipped over one of the parts where I just kind of give you the basics of what we're doing today and I don't want to do that. Skip over that. It's good information for you. We are recording. It's just for note taking purposes. I promise you won't end up on YouTube and I'm not going to ask you to do a TikTok dance or

Daylene Long (14:39):

Anything like that. So it's really just for note taking purposes so I don't have to remember everything and I can say, oh, you know what, I kind of remember that Sarah said this, but I don't remember exactly what it's, and I can go back to the notes. So let's see. Really, our goal today is to give you an opportunity to speak directly to a large well-known supply vendor in the life sciences where you get, they want to understand what it is that's important to you. So we're going to talk a lot about this last purchase that you mentioned you did in your survey. And we're going to ask a lot of questions about it. We're going to ask a lot of who, what and why questions to really understand where you have spots that you are happy, that you trust a vendor that you're excited and on the opposite side what frustrates you.

Daylene Long (15:41):

So we're looking for those kinds of things. And then at the end we'll give you a chance to blue sky brainstorm kind of things that you wish were available either for students or for science educators. It helps people to think of Kim and I as filming a documentary where that's the reason that we ask a lot of these where whys it gives us some context for decision making and that kind of stuff and it just makes for a fuller story as well. So those are kind of the basics. Do you have any questions about those? No. Okay. All right. So you mentioned in your survey that in the last six months you have purchased materials for life science education. Tell me a little bit about that and what was kind of the first moment you thought, okay, I need to put some stuff together for an order.

Sarah Webster (16:47):

So basically, honestly, my original order started in June, so we can't place our orders in our district until at least July. But in June when they told me that I was taking over this virtual stuff and

Sarah Webster (17:03):

Now at that point in June, they did not tell me that I had to repeat that process every four and a half weeks. But they told me that part of our state requirement is that they, that they're doing some sort of lab experiment. So then we had to come up with ways that we were doing some of the labs that the kids really like and get a lot out of in the classroom. In the in-person setting, I had to spend a lot of my June and first part of July figuring out how we could take and do those labs or tailor them to how they could do 'em at home. And so it was a lot of, well, we use this but it's glass and I really don't want to send glass home or what can they use in their kitchen type thing. And so a lot of the stuff that we have bought, at least for me has been lab kits that do have a lot of plastic parts and that will service 30 kits or that we could quickly replicate and rebuy more materials to send those home.

Daylene Long (18:18):

How many lab kits would service 30 students? Do you need 30 because they're going home?

Sarah Webster (18:24):

Yeah, we would have, because each kid, so if they're in it all kind of depends because each school is allotted a certain number of seats in this program. So some of the kids are completely at home, so they would have to be able to do the lab themselves. And then some of the kids are actually in their homeschool school and they might have two or three others that they could maybe partner up with. So it just kind of depends, but 30, because we are also semester-based, teaching 30 kids is about what we have at a time for each of those courses.

Daylene Long (19:06):

So it sounds kind of like you had a new challenge too because you're looking at lab kits from a different perspective and evaluating them from a different perspective. Did you end up putting your own kits together or did you end up finding anything that was

Sarah Webster (19:23):

So

Daylene Long (19:23):

For

Sarah Webster (19:23):

Some of them, some of 'em we could find pre-made and that I could make up solutions ahead of time and they store well, maybe they don't need refrigeration and if I mix 'em up now and they'll be good four and a half weeks from now or even in this time if I have sent something home, our new round of kids starts today and they actually, we don't finish with them until January, so that's a six week with Christmas in there. That solutions or things like that would have to still be either shelf stable or stable in the refrigerator or things like that. So then we also, I had the challenge of coming up with, well if we are sending a solution home, what's the best type of storage to keep it in and ordering those things? And so it's definitely been a challenge.

Daylene Long (20:24):

It sounds like it. Of the kits that you were able to purchase outright, do you remember which ones those were? And let's talk a little bit about what worked with those.

Sarah Webster (20:38):

I know we did a mitosis lab and I think that that one was with the pop beads. Of course the pop beads, it's just counting out the certain numbers that they need. But as far as some of the other ones, I'm trying to remember, do you

Daylene Long (20:59):

Remember Who did the mitosis one where you bought that one from?

Sarah Webster (21:03):

I feel the Mitosis one was actually one that we had here originally to begin with, but I think that we ended up having to order more and don't trying to remember where it came from. I'm digging through an email, emails right quick. I don't remember if that was from Flynn or if that was Wards. I think the pop bead ones we ended up, we did the pop beads with mitosis and then we also did it, we kind of sent the pop beads home for multiple little simulations and labs. So I feel like that it was a Flin box originally, but I could be wrong. So you

Daylene Long (22:16):

Said originally, do you put it into a different storage kit or

Sarah Webster (22:20):

Did you Yeah, so a lot of, if we could buy a pre-made kit, we bought the super, the biggest kits that were available and then sat through and counted and put them in each individual Ziploc baggie and put a sticker on the bag that said Mitosis Lab and then what week it was planned for.

Daylene Long (22:49):

Okay. So we've got the B lab. Do you remember anything else that you thought, okay, I can use this one as it is and buy it from a vendor?

Sarah Webster (23:02):

Not off the top of my head because I know some of 'em we have had to honestly go to Dollar Tree and buy plastic cups and things like that to put them with, and I know some of them were still a work in progress of figuring out exactly what to go with. But my in-person class for me personally because there's not enough time between teaching virtually and teaching in person as well, which is a complete separate class. So I do do a lot of the pre-made kits for those. And I know I have done the Macromolecule lab for wards this year. That was a pre-made kit. I have done it is from, hold on, I'm trying to, we did a gel electrophoresis from another company that was a pre-done kit. And so I had the challenge because in the long run I have three preps and no prep period to be able to get into my actual in-person classroom because it is used all day long. So whatever I prep gets prepped at my desk,

Daylene Long (24:40):

That is an extra challenge. I think that's really interesting and I really appreciate that you went through all the different things that you have to consider when you're sending the kit home because it's a different set of circumstances. How do you handle safety issues?

Sarah Webster (25:08):

So as far as the safety issues, whatever we're sending home are made aware the parents have to sign off on the safety contract, just like our kids, of course it's a virtual signature, so the kids could very well easily turn that in, but we try to make sure that anything that we send home, it's not like a super dangerous chemical if it is ingested, if it is touched without gloves, things like that,

Daylene Long (25:38):

That helps. So you mentioned that you do the majority of your buying, you start thinking about it in June and that you typically buy in July at the beginning of a school Year? So our physical year is

Sarah Webster (25:52):

July one to June 30th, and so we can send our orders into our supervisor before the previous school year gets out, but they won't be ordered or anything like that until July at the bare minimum of July one.

Daylene Long (26:09):

Okay. So your supervisor, is that a district level supervisor or a science department chair Or

Sarah Webster (26:16):

District? I send mine to a district level, but each school, so we have four high schools in our county and each school kind of has their own policy on how that has played out.

Daylene Long (26:30):

Okay. Did they ever push back and say, I don't know either. No, you can't have this or suggesting a different vendor or anything like that?

Sarah Webster (26:47):

Occasionally they'll say, Hey, check out this vendor versus this one because it is cheaper. I know we do the same thing. So last year I taught anatomy and I was asked to use a different vendor than what we had previously used because specimens were cheaper. Do you

Daylene Long (27:09):

Remember who that was?

Sarah Webster (27:12):

I do not. I know I had looked at wards, but I feel like they said it was Carolina that was cheaper.

Daylene Long (27:21):

Okay, okay, that's helpful. The other thing that I always kind of wonder from teachers too, is there anything, let's say you have three vendors and they're all the same price. How do you make a choice then of who you're going to go with and is there any extra added value that a vendor can give that's really important to you?

Sarah Webster (27:50):

So for me, if they're all the same price, I normally just go with whoever I've worked with before, but I have also, it's like who could get it to me the quickest? And thinking about previous purchases, for example, we'll just say Wards has been here in a week versus Flynn only takes a couple days occasionally. So it just kind of depends on a, when do I need the item, how fast can I get it? Honestly, size and how, well honestly, I know for me how well it stores, so in what type of container it's been in, do I have enough room in my storage area for that? If I don't, is there another place in my building that I could store it?

Daylene Long (28:41):

Things like that. That's helpful. What about things like, I don't know, professional development or prep videos or videos for your kids or anything like that? Do you know of any vendors that do that?

Sarah Webster (29:03):

As far as professional development, I have used the flimm, the chem videos when we're doing our biochem unit, just kind of, because I am originally complete total life science person, and so I struggle every year when it comes to biochem, so I'll refresh myself with those videos. And I have also done the Flynn, the safety certification course, but that's just as professional development as far as videos, most of the time I go to whatever is in YouTube and just because I also teach kids of different languages and having the function for the closed captionings at the bottom, I can download the transcripts and I can select for most videos, I can select different languages or I can download an English transcript and transcribe it or have our district people transcribe it into that student's native language so they can easily understand it. Okay,

Daylene Long (30:19):

That makes sense. When you go to YouTube, do you just put in the search bar what you're looking for or do you go to a particular YouTube author or company or anything like that?

Sarah Webster (30:32):

It kind of depends. I do have, like I said, this is year eight, so in the previous seven years I have kind of started to get some of my favorites. Of course for biology, I do a lot of the Amoeba Sisters videos. I've also started to use some of the science teacher, I can't even think of his first name, but the last name is Anderson, and so we'll use a lot of his videos as well in class. And the easier ones are ones that for my kids at least that are short under five minutes or if they're longer, that they're easily plausible that we can go and discuss and not stop in the middle of a thought type thing. So just having those transitions definitely allows me to want to choose that video over others.

Daylene Long (31:36):

So for kids like a five minute kind of reminder or prep on something or if it's longer that there's pauses where it's broken up into?

Sarah Webster (31:49):

Yeah, I teach a lot of low level, so our lower special education, our non-English speakers, so our ELL students, I don't get the, in our building we have honors, we have ap, we have honors, and then we have regular level. So I get a lot of our regular level and very few of the higher honors and aps.

Daylene Long (32:15):

Okay. You guys, you're in Maryland, correct?

Sarah Webster (32:20):

Yes.

Daylene Long (32:21):

And are you allowed in Maryland to provide labs in different languages?

Sarah Webster (32:31):

I have never been told that we couldn't provide them in a different language. I teach or not this year, but in previous years I have taught we shelter our non-English speakers. So they are in, it's just one class of non-English speakers. And so I will actually separate and put their lab groups so that they're working with students that speak their native language because we have seen just the difference versus putting them with a bunch of English speaking students who, and they might not be as strong. So we definitely try to keep them together, but I haven't been told that I can't give them something in their native language. A lot of times I'll give it to 'em in they're native and in English as well, so they can bounce back and forth.

Daylene Long (33:28):

Okay, that's helpful. When you're putting together materials like for year over year, do you go back to or do you ever ask vendors for their PO from past pos or how do you kind of reference back to what it is that you purchased the year before?

Sarah Webster (33:49):

So a lot of times I don't ever see the pos. Normally I just keep a copy of the email that I send to my supervisor letting them know, Hey, I want this, this and this from this vendor. And the same thing. That's what I use when I'm checking everything in is I use that same email.

Daylene Long (34:15):

So looking at the stuff that you buy year over year and the kits and stuff, do they typically give you a budget and they say, Sarah, you've got this much for next year's purchase, how does that work?

Sarah Webster (34:32):

So I have never been given a specific budget, but we get told, Hey, we have X amount of dollars in the district, get me your orders and then we'll get emails periodically from our supervisor. There is X amount of dollars left in the entire county budget to spend by a certain date.

Daylene Long (34:56):

Okay, that makes sense. Do you have an annual budget that you get to draw from for things that come up in between budget cycles?

Sarah Webster (35:07):

Not necessarily. So like I said, we get to keep whatever that amount is, just get spent down throughout the financial year.

Daylene Long (35:19):

So

Sarah Webster (35:20):

It really All goes through the district. It all goes through the district.

Daylene Long (35:24):

Okay. All right. That makes sense. And then you recommend if I have this correct, you recommend which vendors to use, but sometimes the district will come back and say, Hey, consider this one because of whatever reason.

Sarah Webster (35:45):

They give us definitely two, so Word and Flynn to use right off the bat because they do have the contract pricing or special district pricing that does give us a discount. But other than that, they don't specify that we have to use certain people.

Daylene Long (36:05):

Okay. Let's see. I had another question along that and it just flew out because I haven't had enough caffeine yet, which is why I'm hugging this mug right now. Let's see. So one of the questions that we asked on the survey was a little bit about trust and reliability and those types of things. What does it mean to you that a vendor is reliable for you?

Sarah Webster (36:33):

That they can get me the item or that they had the item available to me and they can get it to me in a reasonable amount of time and things like that. What

Daylene Long (36:48):

Is reasonable amount of time for you?

Sarah Webster (36:51):

For the most part, if order something, unless it's a course, the summertime and I'm not in the building, I probably need it within two weeks. There have been times that according to a vendor's website that it's been in stock and I send it and they go to order it and it's telling me that it's out of stock or it's back ordered for three or four weeks, or I end up having to order it or buy it. We'll just say from Walmart for example, and then it comes in because it's not getting to me quick enough.

Daylene Long (37:23):

So they don't tell you in advance that it's back ordered, it's after you place the order, It's

Sarah Webster (37:28):

After it's purchased.

Daylene Long (37:30):

Okay. Let's imagine for a minute that you could know upfront if it was back ordered, what would you do differently?

Sarah Webster (37:46):

I would either a look for a different vendor that would have it and be able to get it to me in the timeframe that I need it or try to come up with something different to use and it's like an alternative.

Daylene Long (37:59):

Okay. Okay. So that's helpful. Let me think. I'm just flipping through my questions here to see, oh, does your district have an Amazon account or is Amazon not an option? How does that work for you guys?

Sarah Webster (38:18):

We do, and Amazon's an option, but in most purchases they try it. They want us to make sure that it's not available through one of the vendor, the major prior approved vendors first.

Daylene Long (38:33):

Okay. Let's see. The other thing that I was thinking, just knowing that you are using Flynn and Morts too, does your school or district, do any of the classes do dissections or have a need for dissections?

Sarah Webster (38:54):

So as far as dissections, our anatomy classes dissect and then biology, I'll say most of our biology teachers will dissect, but it is after our end of course assessment. So normally we have at least three weeks from when we're done state testing for the end of course assessment until the course actually ends. And so that's when we do the dissection piece. And again, it's teacher preference for me in the past. Last year was the first year that my kids have ever even wanted to dissect, and so last year was the first year we dissected, but again, it's completely up to the teacher preference what we do as far as dissections and when we do 'em.

Daylene Long (39:45):

Okay. You mentioned assessments and it sounds like the work that you do up prior to the assessments is really important and that maybe the more fun stuff or the extended learning comes after the assessment. So tell me a little bit about how you get students ready for their assessments.

Sarah Webster (40:09):

So we have 14 weeks to get the students through 24 of the NGSS life standards and for them to have the full confidence that they completely understand the life science and then they are tested in either January or May. And so we will either do, a lot of it is student led learning because our state assessment, it's not just content knowledge, it's the application of that knowledge to a lot of times it's phenomena that's related to, we live near the Chesapeake Bay, so it's a lot of times it's phenomena relating to the Chesapeake Bay. And so it's just teaching them how to break that phenomena down and then apply content to that topic.

Daylene Long (41:08):

So are they multiple choice questions? Are they open-ended? How do you do that

Sarah Webster (41:15):

Complicated?

Daylene Long (41:15):

For the most part,

Sarah Webster (41:16):

It's complicated. So there's five questions. So for each section there would be five questions of multiple choice and then one open-ended. And the tricky part with our end of course assessment, we never know what's going to be on it. We have to cover 27 of the standards. And out of the 27, only 24 are tested and we don't know which three are not.

Daylene Long (41:42):

Okay, interesting. The open ended portion of it, who grades that? So

Sarah Webster (41:51):

This year they are going to be graded by artificial intelligence because it is also being counted as 20. So the state test is now 20% of our students end of course grade. Wow,

Daylene Long (42:07):

Okay. So they're going to be test, excuse me again, caffeine. They're going to be assessed on the open-ended questions, but it's going to be graded by ai. Is that going through the district, the state? Do you have a sense of that?

Sarah Webster (42:29):

From what we're being told, our test is, I'm pretty sure the owner, the publisher of the test is through I think Pearson. So I know in the past they have had teachers work in the week after the test to grade the written responses as far as on the state level. But as far as in the ai, I'm not sure how they're exactly going with that.

Daylene Long (42:59):

That's interesting. Hopefully it saves teachers time, so that's good. And it'll be interesting to see whether or not teachers agree with the assessments from ai. I think that's going to be part of it. Okay. So just in thinking through the prep for your assessments, is there anything you wish existed that doesn't?

Sarah Webster (43:29):

Not necessarily. I mean, unless the magical fairies can figure out ways to make more classrooms and buildings, but that doesn't necessarily happen.

Daylene Long (43:38):

Okay. Are there any vendors that you feel like you are loyal to?

Sarah Webster (43:48):

I mean, for me, I'm pretty loyal to Flynn and that's just my go-to, and I think part of that is that's who, for the most part, the teachers that were here when I first started, those were their go-tos and it was just, oh, we can do one big collective order and save on shipping. And a lot of it's just who they had had, I don't want to say preference, but preference with before I started working here.

Daylene Long (44:20):

So kind of a legacy impairment. Yeah, basically. And is there anything that would make you, if everybody's ordering something from Flynn, is there anything that would make you really advocate for switching?

Sarah Webster (44:38):

I'll voice my opinion and maybe for me, I'm always trying to get the best deal for my money, so we'll just say if wards has something that if we buy it at a bigger quantity, but in the long run when we dish it out into smaller quantities that it's actually going to be cheaper. I sit down and look at the money. But I also, that's just my mentality of trying to make sure that I have enough to go through all year, but also trying to save and conserve and all that kind of stuff.

Daylene Long (45:13):

Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. Stepping back now and looking at the big picture and knowing that this is your opportunity really to speak directly to people who can make a difference in what's available for teachers and for students, what would you like to see that doesn't already exist?

Sarah Webster (45:40):

For me, I, like I said, pre-lab kits, so some of those already exist, but pre-lab or pre set kits for pretty much all labs so that there's not a whole lot of leg, I don't want to say legwork, but there's not a whole lot of prep work on my backend. And again, a lot of that's just for time because the classroom that I am in for my in-person class, it's used all day. So either I would have to come in before school or after school to set up a lab. And so if I do set up a lab, I have to set it up on a cart to be able to wheel in and out of a storage area. And so definitely things that are maybe more shelf stable meaning so that I could set them up three or four days in advance because once a week I do have an additional 40 minutes that I am able to be in that classroom, but I can't necessarily teach or do labs, so I could use that as additional prep time.

Daylene Long (46:48):

So this is just me not being a teacher. What is a pre-lab kit? What is A pre-lab? So a lab that is basically everything is already in that kit. So the

Sarah Webster (47:04):

Fully bought kits that you can buy and I don't have to go searching for

Daylene Long (47:08):

This chemical, this chemical, this chemical

Sarah Webster (47:11):

Or this item and pull everything together. Okay.

Daylene Long (47:16):

Are there any out there for topics that are missing that you're like, I can't find one on fill in the blank?

Sarah Webster (47:25):

Not a topic that I can think of right off the top of my head that, I mean because gotten to the point we share some of ours around.

Daylene Long (47:44):

Okay. Let's switch and talk a little bit about social media. You've mentioned you use YouTube. Are there any other groups or forums or that kind of thing that you are your go-tos for collaborating with other teachers?

Sarah Webster (48:05):

So I am in a couple of different Facebook groups. There's one for biology teachers, and so I'll pull things from there and I'll share things. But as far as, and I'm also in one, so I also have taught anatomy. So I'm in one for anatomy, I'm in one for environmental science because I do teach that. So I definitely am pulling a lot of from there and giving resources. So Facebook is my other big one that I go to. And other than that not, I mean I have accounts but don't have account or that I don't have accounts, but I don't use 'em a whole lot on Instagram and those. So other than Facebook, that's about it.

Daylene Long (48:54):

Okay. All right. That sounds good. I want to bring Kim in and I want to be respectful of our time too. We're getting close to going over. So Kim, do you have any questions for Sarah?

Kimberly Herder (49:10):

I don't. I think you've covered everything. I am absolutely in awe of how you teach remotely and online and then balance that with the classroom because that in itself is just huge. But the online teaching and then online teaching to students that are in a challenging situation in their life, high

Daylene Long (49:36):

Stress.

Kimberly Herder (49:39):

If I had more questions it would be something like that, but I don't even know how to articulate them.

Sarah Webster (49:46):

Yeah, it's definitely been a new adventure with us. And so when they presented, I will say in June when they told me that this is what I would be doing this year, I was not the happiest a person, but I definitely feel like in a way it's kind of lightened my load some because I don't have to deal with the discipline. I can easily just hit the button and send the kid to the waiting room versus being cussed out in person. But it's definitely been, it's come with its own new set of challenges of trying to figure out how to get them and meet the state requirement and do all of this while they're in the virtual setting.

Daylene Long (50:30):

Yeah, it sounds like a big challenge. It also sounds like, I mean it will be interesting to see what comes of the program, but it sounds like a really interesting experiment that if it works well, could solve a lot of problems both for classroom teachers and for schools and districts and that kind of thing. So I applaud you for being brave to take that on. It is brave. Kim, would you walk through for Sarah the next steps of what goes on today?

Kimberly Herder (51:07):

Yes. So today you'll get an email from me that will have a couple, that's a huge thank you, but I'll have two questions within the context. One of them being if that you come up, if there's something that has sparked today or the next couple of days or the next couple of weeks, an idea or a thought conversation, we'd love to hear it.

Sarah Webster (51:33):

Okay,

Kimberly Herder (51:34):

Thank you. And then the next one is if you'd be willing to participate in something like this. Again, we work with a lot of different clients and different questions come up and different ideas come up and would like very much if you're interested to have you involved again. So you'll ponder that one as well. And then, yeah,

Daylene Long (51:59):

Then I was going to say, and at the end of the day when all of our interviews are done, you can expect to get that gift card in your email. We gave you kind of a choice of a few different ways. You can get a Visa gift card, you can get a Target gift card. There's a couple of other choices that we put in there, so you've got some choice over how you use that. Okay. Well thank you again for everything you do. Thank you for everything you do for our students and for other teachers. And thank you for being that brave teacher out there that the schools can go to and say, Hey, you want to start something new that

Sarah Webster (52:40):

We

Daylene Long (52:40):

Don't really know what we're going to do with. So we really appreciate that

Kimberly Herder (52:45):

And caring about those kiddos.

Daylene Long (52:47):

Yeah.

Sarah Webster (52:49):

Yeah, it's definitely been a challenge, but it was a needed challenge, I think.

Daylene Long (52:54):

Good. Well, thank you so much Sarah, and we will be in touch.

Sarah Webster (52:59):

All right. Thank you. Bye.

Daylene Long (00:02):

Tell us about who we're going to be meeting with.

Kim Herder (00:06):

We're about to meet Neil McGovern and Pocono Mountain School District in Swiftwater, Pennsylvania. He teaches at the West High School. He's been with the district for 26 years. Looks like he's been at this school for seven or eight. His wife is the German teacher there. He's known for having lots of animals in his classroom and he's famous for his aunt farm in his classroom.

Daylene Long (00:40):

Interesting. Sure. To ask him about the animals in his classroom

Kim Herder (00:46):

Teaches bio and honors bio. He's also the coach of the environmental club. They don't have, I mean they're, at least from what they have posted, it's mostly core stuff. They don't have a lot of elective sort of things, which maybe they handle that through clubs 67%. The demographic, 67% of the population at the school identifies as black and Hispanic. They have a 95% graduation rate. There was an article about them anyway, how they're bucking the norm. It's either during the summers or formally is a product tester for, I didn't look it up.

Daylene Long (01:47):

How do you spell that?

Kim Herder (01:49):

D-I-A-M-O-N-E-X.

Daylene Long (02:06):

Spell it again.

Kim Herder (02:07):

D-I-A-M-M-O-N-E-X is what I got, or at least that's what I wrote down. It's in Swiftwater, Pennsylvania. The company

Daylene Long (02:35):

Diamond has been developing diamond like carbon and polycrystalline, diamond coating technologies since 1990. In addition to coatings, DMS has developed unique Iron Source technology specifically for the D deposition. The deposition of high quality DLC and DLC, like nano composite?

Kim Herder (03:11):

Well, if he doesn't make diamonds, I don't want it.

Daylene Long (03:17):

I don't think he does, but I think, but a lot of people are these days it's a big industry. Okay. So

Kim Herder (03:30):

That's what I've got. He has very little presence like LinkedIn. He has 17 followers, so he

Daylene Long (03:41):

Okay. Does he list the side hustle with dims? Where did you find that one? At

Kim Herder (03:50):

A bio from the small town newspaper.

Daylene Long (03:55):

Okay, interesting. Did he mention it was during the summer or

Kim Herder (03:59):

He did, but I can't tell. Yeah, it says part-time, whatever, so it doesn't sound, I can't remember how it was worded, but anyway, it led me to believe it was probably more summer teacher, summer something versus after school, but I don't know.

Daylene Long (04:24):

They show a picture of a Goggle Shield on their website saying that it's abrasion and scratch resistant for a variety of plastic materials. Huh, interesting. It always amazes me the different things that teachers will do with the time. Anything else we know?

Kim Herder (05:12):

No. I mean his wife being the German teacher, that's the first time I've had anything pop up about the rest of the family. And then the quote from off of the school, well, it was face Kids on the Facebook. Paige was talking about all the animals in his room.

Daylene Long (05:32):

That's definitely a good place to start when he comes on our call, which we've got a few minutes and remind me again what he teaches.

Kim Herder (05:49):

It looks like three sections of biology and honors bio and then he's the coach of the environmental club.

Daylene Long (05:59):

Okay. Well, you recruited some really good teachers for us, Kim.

Kim Herder (06:11):

Thank you. Thank you. I don't know that I could do a hundred. This was a good number. I mean, I'm definitely getting better and faster on it and had to get back into my learning curve. Okay. Okay. Now, well, how did I figure out last time when I got these kind and stuff, but it started with a great list. I mean the lists you provided were good,

Daylene Long (06:35):

And the other thing is keeping notes and Asana so that the next time you go into it you can just kind of pick up a little bit faster. Remembering what you did is That's how I use Asana. I put my notes in there for projects so that when I go into it again, I just review everything and I'm like, okay, that's what I did. So my Zoom phone is ringing, so I'm assuming, I'm not sure why he's not coming into that zoom. Maybe that's just an alarm to tell me.

Kim Herder (07:21):

Oh,

Daylene Long (07:25):

Kind of obnoxious.

Kim Herder (07:35):

You give him a couple of minutes and then I'll email him or what do you want to do?

Daylene Long (07:39):

Yeah, I'd give him a few minutes. It's just right at two 30 right now. We came on a little bit early

Kim Herder (07:46):

And it's five 30 in Pennsylvania. He could be in traffic, I don't know. Small town. Small town. Poco County.

Daylene Long (07:56):

I don't want to do another driving interview.

Kim Herder (08:00):

No,

Daylene Long (08:04):

The transcription from yesterday where we were getting all that feedback and stuff actually came out pretty well. I was surprised. I mean there were a few things that messed up like, oh, Al g GBS came up as LGBT. That was okay. Neil is ready.

Neil McGovern (08:56):

Hello.

Kim Herder (08:57):

Hi. Neil McGovern?

Neil McGovern (08:59):

Yes. How are you doing, Kimberly?

Kim Herder (09:01):

Good, good. Yes, I'm Kim Herder and we're with Daylene Long and thank you so much for participating.

Neil McGovern (09:11):

Absolutely. Sorry for the delay. My zoom needed to update the second I needed to open it. So

Kim Herder (09:17):

Technology,

Daylene Long (09:18):

Love that.

Neil McGovern (09:20):

Always best.

Daylene Long (09:21):

I know we wanted to start off by hearing about what kind of animals you have in the classroom because we did a little research ahead of this call and we hear you have quite the lively class,

Neil McGovern (09:37):

Quite the lively class. That's nice of you. So as far as animals go, I have no live animals in my classroom right now, and there's a reason behind this. So the reason behind this is they shut the power off constantly in the evening and on the weekends here. So I would have to take the animals back and forth in addition to the fact that our school isn't so fond of people bringing animals anymore. We actually had a situation quite a few years ago where we had a teacher bring an animal into school that was not very controlled, brought a dog in school that I think maybe became aggressive with a couple of the students and they kind of frowned upon that right now. But I used to have a lot, I used to have fish and amphibians. I used to have a pet snake there in the classroom and all those things, but I'm, I'm not in my own classroom right now, unfortunately. I'm sure you can see there's French behind me, not biology, but I unfortunately don't have them in my classroom anymore. I used to have a lot, but

Daylene Long (10:41):

That's too bad. Is that sad to hear stories, but I totally understand with the electricity, especially going out out, I worked with a company that had a large saline fish tank and literally we had to go out and buy its own generator for it so that if the electricity went off, the fish were still alive. So

Neil McGovern (11:07):

I was taking the fish eventually from school to my home every single night and weekend and it became the most unbearable, unbearable task in the entire world. So in addition to a biology teacher, I'm also one of the student council advisors here, and we are really, really, we're a very big, very active student council and it got to the point where it just became impossible.

Daylene Long (11:34):

And then Kim was also telling me that you something to do with Environmental Club.

Neil McGovern (11:42):

It's been a long time. So I'm sure you, based on what you're telling me, you probably found the article in the PO record from a while ago, right? Is that correct? So that was once again with the amount of time you have to make some choices what you do here. So I used to be the environmental club advisor and I was really highly involved in that. And just to give you a little bit of background on our district, it all used to be one school, high school and district. And what happened was 21 years ago, so this was actually a while ago that I was environmental club 21 years ago, the school split because our population became really large and when the school split, they kind of looked for people to take on some responsibilities they didn't have at the time. So I was doing real well with Environmental Club, I continued to do it here.

Neil McGovern (12:33):

And so the other student council advisors, my wife as well, and I was also, you know who the boss is, it's not me. So I was also helping out with student council a lot. And once again, it got to the point where there was only so much time in the day and I felt like we all have things that are challenges for us that bring out the best in us and that interest us. And it got to the point with student council, that and environmental club is very satisfying as well, but just how passionate and active our student council are here really, really pulled me in. And when it got to the point where it was like, okay, I have a committee meeting for student council every single day except for Monday, once every other week. It was no longer fair the environmental but that.

Neil McGovern (13:27):

So basically what happened is half of them joined student council anyway, came over with me, our better ones, and we have some other teachers here who had interest in doing the environmental club stuff. So I kind of passed it on to other people and they took the job and they split it amongst a couple of them, one of the club aspects of it and the other one took the enon aspects of it. So time constraints led to that, but I think I know where you got the idea of all these things Back way back, I won an award for conservation. I later the year, I'm sure it was in the poker record, the article with me holding up the little samples and living things, looking a lot younger, a whole lot younger than I do right now, which is nice. So I'm glad you saw that article if you saw the picture. Yeah, but that was, I used to do that unfortunately. Once again, like I said, I love Environmental Club. There's only so many things you can do in one day. Yeah,

Daylene Long (14:24):

Makes sense. Well Kim, if you have anything else, I'm going to dive right in.

Kim Herder (14:31):

I'm going to jump off screen and I'll handle a technical from the background and then pop in if there's something that might need to a little more follow up or something like that. Okay. I'll be here. Yeah, this is exciting. Sounds

Daylene Long (14:48):

Good. So just a couple of basics, Neil, we are recording today. It's just for note taking purposes so I don't have to remember all of the details. I promise that you won't end up on YouTube or TikTok and you won't be required to dance or anything like that.

Neil McGovern (15:09):

You wouldn't want me to dance. That wouldn't help you. So I think you're okay with that.

Daylene Long (15:13):

Good. So let's see what else. Really our goal today is to find out a little bit more about what you buy for the life sciences, how that experiences for you, how you make your decisions, and the ultimate goal is really to help our client to understand where it is that they can offer you value. We know that teachers are doing more time or doing more with less, and so we want to make sure that we're kind of poking around the edges for ideas of what would make the materials either better for you or better for your students. So that's kind of our ultimate, you're going to see that we ask a lot of what and why questions, and we're just trying to get into the whole experience that you have and if there's any frustration points or if there's any areas where you've just been delighted. We want to know those things and it helps a lot of educators to think of Kim and i's filming a documentary that we're kind of going back to when you first decided that you needed something for your classroom all the way through the end. So those are my basics.

Neil McGovern (16:36):

Yeah.

Daylene Long (16:37):

Any question about those before I dive in?

Neil McGovern (16:40):

No, I think I'm ready.

Daylene Long (16:42):

Okay. So tell me a little bit about the last time that you needed to purchase materials for any of your life sciences or bio or environmental classes.

Neil McGovern (16:55):

That would depend whether you're talking about school budget or me personally buying things out of pocket that we do quite a bit right now.

Daylene Long (17:03):

Let's talk about school budget because yeah, we could talk forever about,

Neil McGovern (17:10):

I'm sure. Yeah,

Daylene Long (17:11):

Yeah.

Neil McGovern (17:11):

So school budget, our school, what we do is we do budget. We basically just did it every October for the next school year right now. So we're actually really early compared to what we used to be When we budget, we budget for the classes, the schedule that we currently teach and it's assumed that if your schedule teaching that right now that applies. So basically the way that we do it is there are some materials that get budgeted that go into a bid process, general classroom wise, colored pencils, markers, things like that, things that are science specific. I usually have the ability to order through non-bid sources using one of our biological suppliers, whether it's ward order a lot from right now, a lot of what we use in class, what's critical, more easy to find on their site, easy to order. We've ordered from other places. Obviously

Daylene Long (18:25):

You're cutting out just a little bit. So I did, I'm sorry. That's okay. You said you primarily buy from wards, but you also buy from other

Neil McGovern (18:33):

Suppliers. Yeah, so depending on the year we might buy from other suppliers as well and what they have at the time pretty much. Can you hear me?

Daylene Long (18:42):

Yeah, I can hear you.

Neil McGovern (18:43):

Okay. Yeah, I'm sorry. So like I said, we kind of search, so we ordered so early, we don't have catalogs yet from the company, so everything is through the online catalogs right now. So if there's something that we want to implement that we don't have awards, I'm going to go to one of the other sites, whether it's Fishers or Fisher or any of them and pretty much work for it. And when I find the one that I like, I'm usually able order it.

Daylene Long (19:16):

Okay. A couple of questions. When you said you set your budget in October for the next school year, do you mean, so this October in 2023, were you setting it for the 20 24 25 school

Neil McGovern (19:30):

Year? That's correct. That's correct. So what the district does is the district has us request all of our supplies and request all of our needs for class because what they want is, and we have a large district, so it's a lot of work for 'em, is they want to make sure that before the end of the year, before the end of the calendar year, and I don't understand all the way the way because all the way why they do that because it wasn't the same a few years ago. They want it budgeted by the end of the calendar year for financial purposes, which is why they have us do our budget in October, not for the new calendar year, but right now we just did it for the 2020 4.5 school year.

Daylene Long (20:13):

That makes sense. I think that always confuses a lot of people too. They're like, why would they do that? But there are several schools that do their budgets the way you just described. And then you mentioned that some of them have to go out for bid. Is there a particular threshold for when you have to go out to bid?

Neil McGovern (20:34):

Not necessarily. What generally goes to bid are just common classroom supplies most of the time. So we do have department chairs and it was a little bit this year, so this year our department chair sent us a spreadsheet of what we considered was mostly the common supplies that people ordered and we just put the numbers in and then she'll send it out for bid. So on bid it's general classroom supplies. In addition to that, there was also a science bid sheet for things that are common glassware, certain chemicals, ethyl alcohol and hydrogen peroxide and things that are, some of the stains that we use would go on bid. So I think what she did is she looked at our past few years and anything she saw, she was getting a number of orders for every single year it went on.

Daylene Long (21:35):

So what are the last kinds of things that you as a teacher said, okay, I need these things from my classroom, and how did you determine what you needed?

Neil McGovern (21:48):

So I determined what I needed based on our curriculum, based on what we teach. So right now I'm teaching two different levels of biology, honors biology and academic biology. And I also teach zoology electives right now. In addition, sometimes I teach anatomy and physiology elective. It just depends on the year. They'll give me whatever fits in that year and I'm good with all of it. So zoology, a lot of the supplies are consumable, a lot of dissection samples, a lot of preserved samples. What I found last year is that, so the zoology class, I usually have it and for a couple years it went to another teacher because they were loading me up with biology because my kids score pretty well in the state test and they needed to move the school forward a little bit more at the time. So it was the replacement of a lot of just preserved samples that we ordered back in the year 2001 or something like that, that essentially prepared slides that we use biology wise.

Neil McGovern (22:53):

There are things that we use that are the general lab activities that you're going to do in most biology classes. So the osmosis, the supplies that needed to continue to carry out gel, electrophoresis, those things, replay microscope that we replace every once in a while I need to worn out. And what I try to do then is I always try to sneak in one or two things. That's kind of a new thing that I'm looking forward to using. And sometimes I get those things, other times I don't get those things. It just depends on the year

Daylene Long (23:28):

You try to get this year that was new that you were excited about

Neil McGovern (23:31):

For years and years and years. I've been trying to get a collection of model skulls for an Evolution lab activity in class and I've been trying for quite a number of years to get it and I stopped asking for a couple of years because I was, no, it costs too much and I don't need it. And it seemed like we were able to order a little bit more this year and I snuck it in and I haven't been told no yet, but I also haven't been told yes,

Daylene Long (23:56):

This is the sometimes it's best Yes, forgiveness than permission.

Neil McGovern (24:01):

Correct.

Daylene Long (24:03):

So a couple questions. You mentioned a few different categories. You mentioned that beakers and gel electrophoresis kits, and you mentioned anatomical models and things like that. So just kind of starting with the gel electrophoresis, do you have a Go-to favorite vendor that you go to for those?

Neil McGovern (24:30):

So I ended up searching for a new vendor this year because one of the products I use changed a lot, so I always use Wards. Wards actually produced a kit where instead of being actual DNA samples, it was the simulated DNA samples. So one of the reasons I always did that is our supplies generally come in in the summer and there's not always somebody here to refrigerator freeze the samples that come in right away. So I was working with that for a while. So last year that kind of ended a little bit and it went to the actual DNA samples, which is also great if things go well. They came in the summer, they didn't get refrigerated and when I did gel electrophoresis, we actually got no results because the DNA was denatured pretty much I was able to locate from somebody else some remaining supplies from the former samples that we had. And once again, we did that and worked perfectly though sometimes just based on the logistics of the building and who's receiving it, when it's being stored, when it's being received, sometimes there's products that just work a little bit better because door and it's not going to be.

Daylene Long (25:50):

Yeah. Do you remember which vendor you selected that was different than Wards?

Neil McGovern (25:57):

I have to look. That was in October. I did that, but I believe I would actually probably have to look and let you know that, but it was a vendor that deals very specifically more with it a genetic technology. I know it wasn't Odin, they don't really let you do the Odin stuff here all the time, even though I'd like to order some of theirs. But it was another supply company, they just not as much, trying to think of who it was, but it might've been Fisher, not quite as many options as Wards had a lot of times, but had some things that they're continuing to offer that Wards doesn't really offer I'm pretty sure was bigger.

Daylene Long (26:50):

Okay. And then you mentioned things like beakers and chemicals and that kind of stuff. Do you remember who you typically buy those through?

Neil McGovern (27:00):

So once again, when they're non-bid, they go through whatever biological supply company. So Wards seems like they've had the best prices on those last bunch of years, which is when I'm to, when you have a class that requires dissection, samples are real expensive and when you order your other samples, they're going to make you up money somewhere. So what I look for is where they're less expensive or if I need beakers, I'll order four per year for four years I have what I need, but they've been coming from wards when I do a non-bid because wards is usually usually the best price plan.

Daylene Long (27:41):

And so you usually buy once a year. Do you also buy throughout the year?

Neil McGovern (27:47):

Well, no. The things I buy throughout the year are basically supplies I'm buying on my own for class and yeah, they don't do.

Daylene Long (27:55):

Okay. And then have you used either Flynn or Carolina as suppliers?

Neil McGovern (28:03):

Yeah, I've definitely used both before. So this past budget there is definitely something I believe from Carolina. I ordered live invertebrate samples and so I think I ordered mealworms through Carolina because no Paria I they Carolina. So when I get the paria from Wards, they're all dead and inactive. When I get 'em from Carolina, they're in much better condition most of the time. And from Flynn, I believe I ordered a couple of replacement microscopes.

Daylene Long (28:41):

Okay.

Neil McGovern (28:42):

Yeah.

Daylene Long (28:43):

Okay, that sounds good. And then lemme just flip through my notes just a little bit. Let's see, I'm just looking a little bit. How do you learn about new things you wanted to try? Let's talk about those skulls for a minute. Do you remember where you first learned about those?

Neil McGovern (29:10):

I honestly, the first time I saw those, I probably saw them in a catalog. So I'm a little bit of a self designer. I like to take activities and create little variations on 'em and redesign a little bit. I saw them in the catalog as part of a kit activity with supplies. And just in my head when I saw it, I knew exactly what I wanted to do with it. I knew I wanted to use an evolution. I knew I wanted to use it to create cladograms. And the procedure I like for Cladograms is I like to make kids take tape and put it on their table and actually position the living things at the end portions of the cladogram. And I knew I really wanted to start it with my honors biology classes and make them develop a procedure instead of using the procedure that comes with it, make them develop the procedure and the actual characteristics and measurements that they're going to use to determine that. And then from that point on with honors biology class, see how it went with them and then maybe move it in a form where they get a little bit, where they get more direction to be in some of the non-honor sections, they would need more direction on it where it's an honor.

Daylene Long (30:24):

Go ahead. So it wasn't something you were actually looking for. You're flipping through a catalog and you see it and the light goes on and that type of thing. Okay.

Neil McGovern (30:34):

Yeah, exactly.

Daylene Long (30:35):

And do you prefer the catalogs to the web or do you use both or?

Neil McGovern (30:41):

So I have to tell you, I love the paper catalog. Once again, the issue for us right now is we're doing our budget in October and we're not getting the new paper catalog until January, February, maybe something or maybe the end of the year. So it ends up being just on the web. For me, the problem with the web is everything's a search and it's so time consuming to do it that way and it's wards is probably the easiest, which is why, another reason I use them a lot, but it's just, it's time consuming. You type in the item you're looking for, you get 16 different choices, you have to click on that as well to see exactly which one is what you want. Whereas in the catalog, for example, with I know with Fisher and awards and catalogs, section glassware, these three pages beakers with a chart on it that says exactly this beaker made of this material in this measurement size, and for one, this is the cost next to it for a pack of 12, here's the cost. It's just really easy to use.

Daylene Long (31:52):

Okay. Is there anything with a catalog that you use to, I've seen somebody, people who've dogeared the pages or use sticky notes or little flags. How do you go through a catalog when you get it?

Neil McGovern (32:07):

That's exactly how I go through a catalog. So I go to the sections that I know, the first thing I do is I go to the sections that I know I absolutely need to order first and they're going to get sticky noted or dogeared and I know to go back to that. Then what I do is I start to look for things that are interesting that I haven't ordered before. And so I might find something with the skulls in it or some of those products and if I think it's something that I can use in a way that's engaging in class, it's active. Many times I'm at the very least going to order if it's a kit rather than get three of 'em right away when I know I would need three for my classes, I might get one and get it in one year first and get everything out and make sure it looks good, and then the next year order the other two so I can use them, use 'em with all the classes.

Daylene Long (33:01):

That makes sense. In the survey that you took, we had a lot of educators responded that reliability was really important to them in terms of being trustworthy. Can you tell me a little bit about what it means to you that a vendor is reliable or trustworthy?

Neil McGovern (33:26):

For me with a vendor, it's very simple that the item I order is what I get and I get it on time.

Daylene Long (33:32):

Okay, okay. And are there any of the vendors you've talked about that you consider yourself to be loyal to?

Neil McGovern (33:43):

Not necessarily. So I think what I'm loyal to isn't necessarily the vendor, it's the service that you get from the vendor. So when you find the vendor that's giving you probably the prices that your school will spend money on and they're going to get you things that are on time and with quality, the quality that you're going to be able to use in class regardless of whether it's Wards, Fisher, Fisher, Flynn, that experience is going to be what creates multiple use.

Daylene Long (34:12):

You mentioned the Arians coming not alive, which isn't good for your class. Have you had any other quality issues with any of the vendors?

Neil McGovern (34:22):

I have. So I will no longer be ordering Elodia from Wards. I ordered two really large packages of Elodia and when they come from wards they come all ground. Whereas when I go on Amazon and I order 'em from Carolina's shop myself, they come in wonderful conditions. So Carolina really has become my go-to sample

Daylene Long (34:49):

For things that are live. Okay. Okay. And let me just flip over to my notes. I'm getting close to the end. So interestingly though, the Elodia incident didn't keep you from buying from wards, just from buying that product from Wards?

Neil McGovern (35:11):

Correct.

Daylene Long (35:13):

Okay, interesting. Okay. Are there any vendors that have particularly delighted you in the last couple of years and what did that look like?

Neil McGovern (35:27):

I'm a pretty level guy. I'm delighted if they get me the stuff on time and it works well.

Daylene Long (35:33):

Okay, that's good. And then before I turn it over to Kim, my last question too is you've got an opportunity here to talk to some of the big suppliers about what's important to you. We know that teachers are doing more with less, and so I'm kind of wondering is there anything that's missing in the market for you or are there any services? What would make your life better as an educator or the learning better for your students?

Neil McGovern (36:10):

This is the primary reason I chose to do this. I actually love this. So there's a couple things that would make things a little bit easier and a little bit better. So the new way in education now is we have to be ready to do the things that we do laboratory oriented in class. You also have to be ready to use in other ways online and different versions of it. If there were companies that offered activities that had both, for example, a lab kit where there was both a physical hands-on version of it as well as a virtual version of it at the same time, that would delight me immediate immediately more than anything, it seems that there's a little bit of a disconnect right now between the actual physical hands-on products and the electronic products. And I think there needs to be, as a teacher, it's my job to take everything and put together and make it work.

Neil McGovern (37:09):

But if that already existed, I think that a company that did that would really, really, really draw a lot of educators in some way. So much is becoming electronic now. Everything we do is through Google Classroom, things like that. And we really, really look to do a variety of both hands-on and even things that are virtual lab. So the virtual lab platforms are somewhat unreliable as well. So our district, when we budget, we budget for gizmos for here, and gizmos is pretty good. They're a little bit short, they're not as realistic as some of the other ones. So what it turns into is it turns into a process where it's search, search, search searched to find a virtual lab that does this, find virtual lab that does that. Then it's once you find it and you have it on your Google classroom ready to go in class, making sure that you go on that virtual website 10 times that week every day to make sure it still works.

Neil McGovern (38:15):

We've all had some experiences with things that don't work when you, of course the day you go to do a class, the virtual transpiration lab, I was just talking to one of my colleagues about this, it works fine all the time. The day you go to do it in class, it's no longer working. So we're always searching for like that. They used to be offered all the time through McGraw Hill and McGraw Hill no longer once, I guess, and I'm not a computer programmer, but once was it Flash or whatever, was no longer, no longer working. A lot of those disappeared and that was an emergency for everybody. Some of the resources transferred over to HTML five, but not all of 'em. And some of those resources go effective. So I would say access to things that are both hands-on in person as well as access to things that are more virtual or online or even game oriented. That to me, that would make such an impression on me and be so usable. So usable in the classroom with the variety that you get with every kid with a, I think that would directly up for work right now.

Daylene Long (39:33):

Okay. So what I was imagining as you were talking, because you said sometimes it was hard to find them and you had to search, you had search that you would have by topic, like a hands-on kit for respiration along with a digital lab for respiration together.

Neil McGovern (39:54):

Once again, that's actually, it's great that you brought that up because that's what we're doing right now. So we're doing bioenergetics. So hands-on lab wise, we use right now what I use is I use the photosynthesis respiration activity that's in two parts and I like to vary activities a lot. I believe students need to be active, a very hands-on, very minds on type of teacher. Along with that, the resource that I use right now for interactive with photosynthesis, respirations actually excellent is the bio site that has games and virtual labs on it. So I dunno if you're familiar with that, but the bio site is, yeah, the bio site is excellent and his interactives, his little games is playing video games for the kids, his interactives with photosynthesis and respiration. There's no way you can't learn what it's taking in and letting out things like that just because win the game, you have to do that and the kids get so obsessed with winning the game, then you go back and you talk to 'em about, okay, so tell me, what did you have to do to get out of the mitochondrial matrix?

Neil McGovern (41:05):

Oh, we had to go through that pump, that a TP synthase pump when it turned and let us out. Okay. So what is that showing you in real life? What were you playing? Oh, I was this hydrogen ion and okay, so look at this. What did you just learn and oh, I see what I just did now I know I did that. So they worked together just really, really well. So many kids with so many different learning styles. You can't successfully be a teacher anymore that we had in high school where it was lecture all the time and things like that. That's not how things work anymore. It's got to be experienced, experienced hands-on experience where the experiences lead the lead into the learn lesson, not the other way around where the learn lesson is.

Daylene Long (41:56):

Okay. So you mentioned a couple things I want to follow up on too. You kind of alluded to why you use the digital with the hands-on when you talked about learning styles, but I wanted to make sure I'm understanding correctly. What's the biggest advantage to you and your students of having both the hands-on and the digital component?

Neil McGovern (42:17):

It's skill development, and I preach this to kids all the time. I ask them on an everyday basis, what's more important? Memorizing a list of 10 words or knowing how to do something, the answer is always very clear. It's knowing how to do something. So when you develop basic skills, whether it's technology, whether it's hands-on experimental procedures, experimental design, it's going to be a lot easier to fit the information in once you have the skill and the concept than it to try to fit a skill or a concept.

Daylene Long (42:48):

Concept. Okay. And then, let's see, there was another thing in there. Oh, you mentioned when you were talking about the Gizmos, that some of them looked more realistic than others. Do you have a preference and do your students have a preference as to whether or not they're highly animated or realistic looking? What are your thoughts on that?

Neil McGovern (43:09):

Not necessarily. It depends what you do with it. So I mean, I would say there's not really a different,

Neil McGovern (43:21):

Gizmos are more animated. It doesn't look quite as realistic, but you're doing the same thing as you would even though the animals might look animated or whatever. So I think the kids got it.

Daylene Long (43:31):

Okay. Anything else that has been in the back of your brain going, oh, I wish we had this.

Neil McGovern (43:41):

No, not really. So I'm pretty experienced. I'm in my 28th year of teaching right now, so I'm a designer and a collector, so I fidget with things. I can't leave it alone. It's how I live my life. I do it at home with everything. So whatever activities I use I constantly fidget with and try to improve them and try to change. I have four file cabinets in my office full of every single version of a lab activity that I've done every year for 28 years now that I can go back to as I need. So just having options and maybe sometimes materials. So I know we're moving toward NGSS standards right now and it, it's not the first time that this and tried to implement it. I remember way back many years ago when I first started teaching at the big community contact, basically what N Bs does S is, but part of NGSS is activities where students were a little bit and it's less of a, but once again, what I think we need that I'll take, I manipulate those make.

Daylene Long (45:03):

Okay. That makes sense. Kim, do you want to pop in and do you have any questions?

Kim Herder (45:12):

I do. This has been fascinating and I really want to come hang out in your class for

Neil McGovern (45:16):

Oh, you should come hang out. That'd be fun. Well fun.

Kim Herder (45:21):

I have a son who is gifted but at the same time is deaf. And so I'm always a little curious on differentiation in the classroom and how you address it. How much work does that cause you?

Neil McGovern (45:41):

It's a lot of work. I've definitely had gifted students in class before I had two last year. I've had quite a few. First of all, they're the most awesome kids ever to begin with. So I'm happy. I'm happy. I've had a blind girl in class that ended up at Harvard when she graduated here, so they're the most awesome kids ever. I love working with them. I'm kind of multimodal already, just kind of how I am a lot of times. And I think a lot of times I end up with kids that have those kind of sensory disabilities in class because I know that if they put them in with me, it's going to be a little bit easier. It's going to be maybe a little bit more visual or more. And my hearing impaired students do really, really well with visual. They do really well with hands-on, and I probably do more of that than most of the teachers in the building right now.

Neil McGovern (46:45):

So they know when they come in they're going to get that. Aside from that, it really depends on the student a little bit. So I'm sure with your son, every student being impaired has a different degree of abilities with different things, whether it's visual or hands-on or things like that. And I just, especially an honor student, a high functioning student who wants to do well and just has one issue that prevents them from doing well, that's a kid you want to work with. And any of the supplies that we have, once again, making things hand on making visual, making it active, it's going to benefit every single kid having class, but it's really, really going to benefit. Kids need the most.

Kim Herder (47:34):

Well, thank you for doing that,

Daylene Long (47:36):

Kim. Any other question? And then you can give Neil kind of a wrap up on next steps.

Kim Herder (47:46):

So no, I don't have any more questions, but I do want to invite you tomorrow you'll get an email from me that will kind of summarize that a little bit, but also at the same time ask you for anything that you've pondered either during this time or come in the future with invitation to get back to us with that, how to get ahold of us. And also if you're in that, if you'll let us know if you would be interested in participating in something like this. Again, whether this program or something in the future.

Neil McGovern (48:28):

I can tell you right now, I'm definitely interested. I like this. So yeah. Okay,

Kim Herder (48:32):

Good. Well good, because I think we like you too. And then also your $95 gift card, we had said it was going to be an Amazon gift card, but it's actually a Visa gift card or office. Okay. And that will be coming from DA's email address. So any additional questions or thoughts or things like that, we'll handle it that way and look forward to doing something with you again.

Neil McGovern (49:03):

Absolutely. Thank you. Actually, once again when I saw this, it's something that looking for feedback on things that you use in class and materials and things that have benefit in the classroom, I'm all for it every single time. I love it.

Daylene Long (49:18):

Awesome. That's great. I will probably send out the next batch of gift certificates tomorrow morning. If for some reason you don't get it by the end of the day tomorrow, look in your spam folder. And if it's not in your spam folder, call Kim or email her, but it should be there tomorrow.

Neil McGovern (49:38):

Okay, thank you.

Daylene Long (49:39):

All right, Neil, it's been wonderful talking to you and thank you for all that you do for students and you sound just like an amazing biology teacher and we need all the amazing teachers we can get out there. Students need the challenge. So thank you.

Neil McGovern (50:00):

Yeah, thank you. I agree with you. We need a lot more people ready to go here with everything.

Daylene Long (50:08):

Okay, thank you so much. Bye.

Kim Herder (08:24):

Yes. Hello Amanda? Yes. Hey. Hi. I'm Kim Herder and I'm with Daylene Long and so glad you're doing this for us. So we're on Pacific time, so we're still morning, year after lunch, I imagine

Amanda Fuller (08:56):

That is right.

Kim Herder (08:57):

Well, we are very excited to have you. I'm particularly excited to say two things. One on the school, what your school webpage, it says that you're state champions. Is this football?

Amanda Fuller (09:08):

We were state champions three years ago in football.

Kim Herder (09:14):

It still says state champions.

Amanda Fuller (09:15):

Oh, at some point. Yes, we were state champions.

Kim Herder (09:17):

Okay, well congratulations

Amanda Fuller (09:19):

Out of playoffs. Yeah,

Kim Herder (09:20):

Congratulations on that. Okay, but you're continuing in the playoffs?

Amanda Fuller (09:23):

That's right. Well we just finished. They got put out right the fourth round, so we don't get to go, but we were close.

Kim Herder (09:31):

Okay, well good try. I want to say thank you. I was the military bratt and I saw the, it said 20 plus percent of the kiddos belong to military families.

Amanda Fuller (09:45):

That's right.

Kim Herder (09:47):

That's okay. So which affiliations or bases are near?

Amanda Fuller (09:51):

So we have Maxwell Air Force Base and Gunnar Air Force Base both in Montgomery, which is, we're a little small town right outside of Montgomery. So we allow any military families, active duty, military to come to our district even though they're not zoned for here, the Montgomery schools are not Fantastic.

Daylene Long (10:15):

That's great. That's a really nice thing.

Kim Herder (10:18):

I appreciate that because that was, I mean, a lot of years ago, but my parents would always do something so that we weren't generally either on campus or schools on base or someplace they didn't want us. So appreciate that.

Daylene Long (10:36):

Well Kim, if you don't mind, I'll go through some just the basics and Amanda, then I'll just ask you some questions specifically kind of focusing on life science and different types of things that you use in the classroom. Our goal today is really to get some more information for one of our clients on how they can best serve teachers, how they can best make the resources available for you that you need. We are recording it today, but I promise you won't end up on America's Funniest Home videos or your students to be able to see or anything like that. It's just for note taking purposes

Kim Herder (11:13):

And I'm going to step off camera, so make sure we Okay.

Daylene Long (11:17):

Okay, that sounds good. Let's see.

Amanda Fuller (11:23):

Clarify something before you get started. Absolutely. So I don't if I answered something a certain way, but this year I'm not teaching life science. I do work for a plus, I contract through a plus and I write curriculum for seventh grade and I teach professional development to life science teachers, but I'm currently teaching anatomy and physiology. So I don't know if that makes a difference or not.

Daylene Long (11:49):

It does. That's wonderful. That all works out just fine. I'm going to be particularly interested in hearing about your professional development experience and what teachers are needing these days, but your anatomy and physiology background is great too. Okay, so we're good. So you're going to see that we're going to ask a lot of why questions. What questions we're going to ask you how you feel about these things, or at least tell us if there's frustration points. We want to know that if there's areas that really delighted you or made you happy or made your students happy, let us know that too. The best way to think of this is that Kim and I are filming like a documentary of how you go about buying and using life science materials, including anatomy and physiology. And so we, we'll kind of cue you from time to time to say, okay, do you remember when you decided that you were going to get this and that type of thing. That's kind of the overview. Do you have any other questions before I dive in?

Amanda Fuller (13:01):

Nope.

Daylene Long (13:01):

Okay. You mentioned in some of the screening and some of the surveys that we did that your science department chair and when was the last time you bought something for anatomy and physiology or for life sciences for your department?

Amanda Fuller (13:23):

So at the beginning of this year, well a little bit further into it, we got a grant and I was able to spend about $8,000 on just purchasing for our department. So I made all those purchases by the end of October and I would say over the last month I've gotten a bunch of stuff in.

Daylene Long (13:45):

So how do you decide what it is that your department needs?

Amanda Fuller (13:49):

So for this particular thing, I sent out a survey and my superintendent asked at a committee meeting that I'm a part of for us to make a wishlist. So I just sent the wishlist out, said tell me if we could do anything, what is it that you would want to purchase? And so they made a wishlist and then I kind of categorized it by things that would affect students directly, things that would be just kind of models and things that would be helpful to us, but the kids wouldn't directly have contact with it, so we just kind of split it up into categories and then they gave us a certain amount of money and said spend it. So we did.

Daylene Long (14:29):

And then how did you decide, so you categorized, just want to make sure I understand, you categorized it cut by what's going to affect students the most and a few, sorry, one

Amanda Fuller (14:40):

Second. I have a student at the door. Okay, nevermind. She realized I'm in the middle of something. Keep going. Sorry. No

Daylene Long (14:45):

Worries. So you mentioned that you categorize it according to what's going to have an impact on students, what might just be needed for other reasons and that type of thing. And then did you give priority to one of the other categories

Amanda Fuller (15:01):

When you Definitely things that students would put their hands on. So lab materials, we did some dissection stuff and then kind of lower were things like I know one group requested a set of books, like textbook type things, and that was kind of lower on the category list.

Daylene Long (15:26):

You decide who going to buy from. So you've got probably a wide variety of different types of things that your department's asking for. How do you decide which vendors to go to?

Amanda Fuller (15:39):

So the first priority was cost compared prices, then what would be easiest for me? So obviously we've ordered from Flinn and from Carolina before, so I went with those first and Amazon. And then there were a couple things that could only be purchased through specific vendors and then obviously had to purchase from them.

Daylene Long (16:05):

Do you remember any of the things that needed to be purchased through specific vendors?

Amanda Fuller (16:09):

Yeah, there was a empathy belly that was a specific thing. And so my class follows fetal development for the school year and so at the end of the year we let them wear the belly and feel what it feels like to be pregnant and that kind of thing. So there are only a couple of vendors that sell that. So I had to get their W nine and do the whole get them on our vendor list. That was one. And then we had never ordered from microscopes.com and so we ordered bulk of those microscopes and so they just had the best price so I could just get more for my money with them.

Daylene Long (16:52):

And you hadn't ordered from them before, but it was really price that tipped you over from maybe one of your other standard vendors like Flinn or Carolina you mentioned in the beginning.

Amanda Fuller (17:03):

Yep.

Daylene Long (17:04):

Do you have a preference of Flinn, Carolina when you're looking?

Amanda Fuller (17:08):

Not really.

Daylene Long (17:09):

Okay. Does your district have a contract with either of them?

Amanda Fuller (17:14):

It's not, I don't know. Right now we just got something new called ClassWallet and so I don't know if that's a contract for us or a class wallet has a contract. So one of the accounts that I order from has to be through Class Wallet. So I'm not sure about the contract, but I don't think we have contracts with either of 'em from the school to Carolina or school to Flinn. I think we just have their W nine and we have just an account set up.

Daylene Long (17:48):

Okay. Do you remember what you bought from Flinn and or what you bought from Carolina?

Amanda Fuller (17:55):

I could tell you what we got from a combination. So I know we got some dissection, some hearts to dissect. We some, we have a forensics class, so we got some fingerprinting materials, we got synthetic blood, we got a lot of glassware, but I couldn't tell you which came from which vendor. Okay.

Daylene Long (18:27):

How did you decide between those two vendors which was going to get one set of things and which was going to get the others?

Amanda Fuller (18:33):

Cost.

Daylene Long (18:34):

Cost. Straight up cost. Okay. Do either of them provide professional development for you?

Amanda Fuller (18:43):

Not that I know of.

Daylene Long (18:44):

Okay. I had somebody recently say to me that most teachers do a lab once a year, may do it across different sections, but they're usually only doing it once a year when they're teaching a topic and that having some sort of pd, whether it's asynchronous or in person, is helpful. I wanted to get your feedback on that of how your district and your school approach professional development when it comes to the hands-on science.

Amanda Fuller (19:23):

So we do use a plus, which is the group that I was telling you that I work for and for the science department, a lot of our professional development, I guess I'm talking from both sides. So a plus provides professional development and a lot of our professional development revolves around teaching them how to use the labs. And then we also have science in motion, which is called Asim, and they provide both supplies and they provide professional development for the particular science labs.

Daylene Long (20:01):

Science in motion is the van or the bus that kind of goes around that does some training and has hands-on materials. And then the a plus organization that you were talking about, do they provide training that's in person or is it It's in person. It's in person. Okay.

Amanda Fuller (20:25):

Yeah, so it's a week over the summer and then a couple days in the fall and a couple days in the spring.

Daylene Long (20:33):

And then you mentioned that you've started to get some of these materials right. Okay. So when you get stuff, do you have a preference of how it's sent to you? What's included with it? What makes your life the easiest on the receiving side of things?

Amanda Fuller (20:56):

I don't think I have a preference.

Daylene Long (20:58):

Okay. Alright, that's fine. And then I want to go back to the professional development for a second. If any of the vendors that you used provided some sort of professional development for teachers and or lab prep for students, meaning videos or things to read or simulations before they do the labs, would any of those be helpful for specific topics that you think would be most in demand?

Amanda Fuller (21:40):

I couldn't think of anything off the top of my head, anything specific.

Daylene Long (21:45):

Okay. So thinking about your role as an anatomy and physiology teacher, then let's go into that a little bit. If you had either one of those, either resources to help you right before you teach a certain thing every year, you mentioned that you bought some hearts. Were they cow hearts?

Amanda Fuller (22:11):

They were sheep hearts.

Daylene Long (22:12):

Sheep hearts. So let's just kind of think about that lab for a second. Is there anything, in an ideal world, what kind of reminders or prep would you have every year and what would your students have?

Amanda Fuller (22:31):

I've been doing this for several years, so I've got kits made up. So that would be helpful if they came as a kit with either the scissors or scalpel or whatever, the pens and the plate and maybe the mat that has the instructions, that would be beneficial? Is that what you're asking me?

Daylene Long (22:54):

Yes.

Amanda Fuller (22:55):

How to package it?

Daylene Long (22:57):

Yeah, how to package it or any kind of video simulation prep that you would have a student look at the day before to make sure that the lab ran efficiently.

Amanda Fuller (23:17):

I think if I were brand new to it, if I haven't done this for several years, it would be super helpful to watch somebody else teach it to their class. So maybe just a quick run through of this is what my kids should be doing when I'm doing this, this is what I should be looking for. Maybe a video or a picture of here's the aorta on an actual model. So maybe something like that for the teacher to watch before she did it. Her student.

Daylene Long (23:46):

Okay. Yeah. And what about the student themselves?

Amanda Fuller (23:51):

The student themselves? I mean, I do direct instruction before, maybe just a safety, if this is the first time they've dissected something, maybe just a little safety video. I mean, I guess as a first year teacher it would be helpful for there to be a walkthrough for students, but I feel like in general for my students watching it before and listening to the instructions before, it's not going to be as beneficial. They need it chunked. So let's do step one. I'm sorry.

Daylene Long (24:35):

It's okay. If you have students coming in, that's fine.

Amanda Fuller (24:39):

So for me, let's do step one and maybe that would be something, a video that you could watch pauses, keep going, watch pauses, keep going. So maybe just chunked. It's like let's all do this together, pauses, look at A, B, and C. And then now let's move on to step two. Look at A, B and C, maybe something like that.

Daylene Long (25:00):

Does your school have any limitations over videos? Meaning are there any channels that are blocked or do you have to use them from any particular vendor?

Amanda Fuller (25:15):

We have a ton of stuff blocked for students, but for a lot of our videos we are able to unblock them for our kids.

Daylene Long (25:22):

Oh, that's great. The teacher, you yourself as the teacher can unblock it.

Amanda Fuller (25:27):

Right.

Daylene Long (25:28):

Okay, that's great. Let's see. I'm going to flip through my questions real fast. So I want to go back to a couple of things. I want to go back to the differentiating between a Carolina and a Flinn. And you mentioned that you didn't really think about the difference too much. Are there, the majority of people when we sent out the survey said that reliability was a top factor for them, and you're also mentioning that price is a top factor. So walk me through just a little bit whether or not you've had any particularly good experiences or particularly bad experiences with any vendors in the last year or two.

Amanda Fuller (26:25):

Okay, good experience. Everything that I order, I think Amazon is just an easy vendor to use, add it to my cart, let it sit there until I'm able to place the order. So I usually order once a month, so my teachers will put into a spreadsheet for me, I'll add it to the Amazon account and I'll just let it sit there and then just click my little button and it sends it to my purchasing department. So Ease has been for Amazon, I really like that. I think it's, which I guess probably answers, but Carolina or Flinn, I can't remember which one. There's currently a Backorder item, so I would like to know that ahead of time before making the purchase. So that would be kind of a negative. So I made the purchase and it's been, I ordered everything before the end of October and I still get emails saying that there's an item that we ordered that's backorder. So if I needed that item specifically right now, if I ordered it because I'm about to start a unit and then I found out that it was backorder, it'd be pretty frustrated.

Daylene Long (27:38):

Okay. So how would you like to know about it upfront? What would make that better for you?

Amanda Fuller (27:45):

Probably as I add it to the cart

Daylene Long (27:48):

That it tells you when you add it to the cart that it's back order. Okay. Amazon for a minute. Does your district or school then have an account with Amazon? Because you mentioned you put it in your cart and then it goes to your purchasing department.

Amanda Fuller (28:06):

So we have Amazon business set up, and so it's just a super convenient and method. She just sends me a PO order or a PO number that I put directly into the Amazon cart and then it just ships. So it's just super convenient.

Daylene Long (28:28):

And you do that about once a month? How much do you spend? About once a month, just kind of average ball parking

Amanda Fuller (28:36):

One month that maybe $50 one month, that maybe 500. It just depends on the needs of

Daylene Long (28:43):

Whatever.

Amanda Fuller (28:44):

Yeah.

Daylene Long (28:45):

Okay. That makes sense. Let me see what else I have. So with Amazon, are there any particular things that you buy from them that you know of that you can,

Amanda Fuller (29:00):

Random stuff? So last month I ordered something called Miracle Berries. I ordered it for our biology teacher. I'm not sure what they're being used for. I ordered batteries for our, I think it was for some lights that we have. We ordered just Ziploc bags. Those are just some things that I can think of that I ordered off of our last Amazon order. Some Lysol wipes,

Daylene Long (29:32):

But when it comes to beakers and that kind of thing, do you buy those from Amazon?

Amanda Fuller (29:37):

If they had a good price, I probably would, but normally those come Carolina or Flinn.

Daylene Long (29:42):

Okay. And what about the things like the Cow Hart or I don't know if there's anything that you buy that's live like

Amanda Fuller (29:54):

Those would be Carolina or Flinn also.

Daylene Long (29:57):

Okay. All right. That's helpful. Kim, if you're still there, I want to turn it over to you and see what other questions you might have. She might be off.

Kim Herder (30:09):

Nope, I'm here. I just had to make sure I got all it clicked. Tell me a little bit about the students and the other teachers. The other teachers that you're working with, and then you're kind of your, well just start with that. You're a department chair, so the other teachers that report to you, what are their backgrounds and how do they handle things?

Amanda Fuller (30:34):

I'm not sure which mean, so I have a chemistry teacher, he's like a third year teacher. I have two biology teachers. One is a 20 year veteran, one is brand new teacher, maybe second year teacher, and then two other teachers. Is that what you're asking me?

Kim Herder (30:54):

Yes, that was the first part. And then how with you doing professional development and that sort of thing too, how much time do you spend with them or where are the needs that maybe they need? They have,

Amanda Fuller (31:07):

The professional development that I have is just a contract job that I have. So over the summer and then throughout the school year, so I helped write curriculum that's then dispersed to teachers across Alabama. So it's not just my school. So helped with the curriculum development. And then once during the summer I'll do a week of training for teachers that come from across the state on the curriculum that we developed

Kim Herder (31:38):

In. Those do, this is your needs list and this is where to get 'em. I know like a kids Christmas list.

Amanda Fuller (31:47):

Yes, we do have a very specific, when I'm training, these are the things that I need to have available to me, but I don't have any say so over where it comes from. I just give it to my content director and she's responsible for ordering. I mean, I suppose I could say this is where I found it, but

Kim Herder (32:07):

Then when the teachers that are going through the professional development, do they leave with the curriculum and embedded in the curriculum? Is there a list there and does it say, sorry, I'm getting really into the weeds. Does it say you may find these at or

Amanda Fuller (32:31):

No, there's not any direct where you can get them. There is a list, but we do, so if they're on a grant, we give them money and then we also will ship them a bunch of supplies. So whatever they need to use the curriculum for the first couple of years. So I think that they order A from, I would assume wherever they have a contract or wherever they can get the best price for the consumable things. I think we just say these are the things that you need. And I don't think that we have a list of where to find them.

Kim Herder (33:10):

Okay.

Daylene Long (33:11):

Kim, I had a couple of other branding questions that came to mind. This is a branding question, but it's also about how these vendors sit in your mind. If I ask you to name three adjectives to describe Flinn, what would you think of

Amanda Fuller (33:40):

Three adjectives to describe Flinn? Convenient. And I don't know,

Daylene Long (33:57):

You can stop at too if you need to. And what was the last one

Amanda Fuller (34:02):

I said? Okay, that's perfect if I can.

Daylene Long (34:04):

Alright, Carolina, what are the top two words that come to mind when you think of Carolina?

Amanda Fuller (34:10):

Honestly, the same. To me. There's no differentiation between one or the other or they're, in my mind, they're the same thing. If I google this particular sheep heart and Carolina's the first one that comes up, I'll use Carolina Flinn's, the first one that comes up. I'll use Flinn. I'll compare prices, but it's the same in my head.

Daylene Long (34:35):

Okay. And you go to Google to see what's coming up? What I just, yeah, I

Amanda Fuller (34:39):

Mean most of the time I'd probably put in Flinn and look up sheet parts and then I'll put in Carolina and put in sheet parts and just compare prices. But I don't pick one over the other for any particular reason other than the price.

Daylene Long (34:54):

And then Amazon, you used a couple of words too. What were the words that you used with Amazon? I'm trying to think.

Amanda Fuller (35:03):

Probably super convenient.

Daylene Long (35:08):

Okay, that sounds good. Kim, back to you. I want to see if we can wrap this up at 1130 so that we can be super respectful of Amanda's time.

Kim Herder (35:22):

What else do you want to tell us? I mean that's jumping to that, but in your position, in your history, what is your ultimate that when you work with whether it was a Carolina Flanner or an Amazon, what's missing?

Amanda Fuller (35:42):

I mean, I honestly don't think anything, sorry,

Amanda Fuller (35:49):

There's a little fly around here. We have open doors open and close all day long. I don't think there's anything, there's not been any time that I've been frustrated that I couldn't find anything or that I needed anything. One, they're one and the same to me. I know they're totally different companies, but one is just as easy to use as the other. And I think my school has made Amazon super convenient is why I would choose them. But I mean, just ease of use. We have an account I can put in my, I type in the first four numbers or first couple numbers of my school and the address comes up. It's just, it's easy. And when I need to order something, it takes me five minutes versus I've got to get the W nine and I've got to get this and I need to back and forth emails and stuff is

Daylene Long (36:49):

Okay. One last question. And this one is just about you in general. Do you have any particular brand, and it doesn't have to do with your job, it could be a car or a cell phone company. Do you have any particular brands that you love that you just feel kind of on a visceral level? Oh my gosh, I love,

Amanda Fuller (37:18):

I recently got an Audi, so I love that. That's a brand that I love.

Daylene Long (37:26):

What do you love about that brand?

Amanda Fuller (37:29):

Everything's just very well thought out. I guess luxury feeling versus none of the plasticy

Daylene Long (37:42):

Quality.

Amanda Fuller (37:44):

Yeah.

Daylene Long (37:45):

Okay. That sounds good. Kim, anything from you and you want to tell Amanda about next steps?

Kim Herder (37:55):

So next steps are that I'll be sending you a follow-up email, a thank you, and it will have the Amazon gift card link attached. It'll also have some opportunities if you think of something else that you want to add. And I'll go directly to Daylene and please do that. I mean, nothing's too small in adding the data or the information that we're going on. And yeah, if you want to give me your cell phone number or something like that if you want. And it also helps with the gift card if anything happens in that transfer. But very much appreciate your time and what you're doing and life in the classroom and managing other teachers.

Amanda Fuller (38:44):

Well, thank you. So are y'all doing work to start another Carolina, or what is your research for? Do you mind me asking?

Daylene Long (38:55):

Absolutely. And I actually told the client that at the end of the calls we would make it apparent who the client is and the client is Carolina. And we're trying to look at all the different ways that they can make the process the products better for you. How can they make it so that you save time, that it's reliable, that you think broadly about the types of things that you would want to buy from Carolina. And so they're really reacting to, there's been covid changed everything for educators. It's commonly known that you guys have less time and more demands than you've ever had before. And so the focus of our research is what can we do to make things better for you? And with that as a framework, you might have something else to add. I'm not sure. What do you think?

Amanda Fuller (40:12):

I don't think so. I think one of the things when I was looking for wishlist items, I put in anatomy and physiology and just looked at their stuff. But again, was it Flinn or was it Carolina? I don't know. But the organization of these are some things that might be of interest. If you're an anatomy teacher, everybody doesn't get the luxury of saying, if I could spend any amount of money, what would I want? But that was one of the times that I used it and was just kind of like, okay, this is helpful.

Daylene Long (40:51):

Yeah, so that's really our focus is that Carolina wants to just make sure that they're doing everything they can for teachers right now because we do know things have changed and you doing more with less. Okay.

Amanda Fuller (41:36):

Of course. Obviously a gift card. It's never heard a thing.

Daylene Long (41:43):

All right, sounds good. Thank you again so much, Amanda, and thank you for everything that you do for our science students in the world. We really appreciate that.

Amanda Fuller (41:53):

Thank you.

Daylene Long (41:54):

Yep. Talk to you later. Okay, bye bye-Bye. I'm going to stop.

Daylene Long (00:02):

I am going to admit her. Can you hear us?

Kelda Bailess (00:27):

I can. Hi, Can you hear me?

Daylene Long (00:32):

Yes. Hi, how are y'all?

Kimberly Herder (00:35):

Good, good. Well, it's

Kelda Bailess (00:37):

Good

Kimberly Herder (00:37):

Morning here, but good afternoon to you.

Kelda Bailess (00:41):

So thank you for joining. Good afternoon. Oh, you're welcome. So

Kimberly Herder (00:46):

I'm

Kelda Bailess (00:46):

Kim Herder, and this is Daylene Long, and Daylene is the one that's, as the lead researcher is going to be asking you the questions. I am going to be here, the tech in

Kimberly Herder (00:57):

The background, And what We're doing is hoping first is that you'll take a minute and tell us a little bit how you ended up in your position and who you are and we'll dive into

Kelda Bailess (01:13):

What we'd like to know. Okay. So my name is Kelda. It's pronounced like Zelda with a K, but I'm currently first year administrator at a high school. I'm also over the science department. The past about 10 years I taught high school biology and also when I'm not in school, I'm the county deputy coroner. So I love science. So you've

Daylene Long (01:51):

Got quite a few things going on there.

Kelda Bailess (01:54):

Yeah, quite a few.

Daylene Long (01:58):

You mentioned you were the administrator at the high school. Is that like an assistant principal or a principal or,

Kelda Bailess (02:04):

Yes, Assistant principal. Okay. All

Daylene Long (02:07):

Right.

Kelda Bailess (02:09):

And

Daylene Long (02:09):

How long have you been doing that for?

Kelda Bailess (02:12):

Just this school year.

Daylene Long (02:14):

Just this school year. Okay. Yes. So we'll be able to talk about some of your biology purchases in the past, and it's still pretty fresh in your mind,

Kelda Bailess (02:23):

Right?

Kimberly Herder (02:24):

I'm going to jump off camera, but I'll be in the background, so,

Kelda Bailess (02:29):

All right.

Daylene Long (02:32):

So Kel, let me go through just some of the basics and then we'll just dive right in. We are recording. It's just for note taking purposes. I promise you won't end up on you YouTube and I won't

Kelda Bailess (02:46):

Ask you to do a TikTok dance and you won't find it in any way. So

Daylene Long (02:52):

It's just so I don't have to remember everything. So That is going that way.

Kelda Bailess (02:59):

Let's see, what else do we have?

Daylene Long (03:04):

Really our goal today is looking at educator voices around what's available for the life sciences and biology

Kelda Bailess (03:15):

In terms

Daylene Long (03:16):

Of what vendors can supply. Our client really wants to keep continually improving things for teachers and for students and really trying to keep an ear out for what's important for you, where you've had experiences, where you've had bad experiences, that kind of thing. Let's see. You'll see that we ask a lot of what and why questions and that it's good to kind of frame it in terms of thinking of Kim and I as filming a documentary. We're going to ask a bunch of stuff and you're going to think why do they need to know that? But it just kind of give us the whole picture of what's going on. So that's kind of all of the basics. And you mentioned in your survey that you had bought some materials for life sciences in the last six months. And tell me a little bit about that and start with

Kelda Bailess (04:23):

What was the

Daylene Long (04:24):

First moment that you thought, oh, I need to start putting together something for a purchase?

Kelda Bailess (04:32):

Actually, I guess I didn't mention that. I also, during the summers I do a forensics camp for high schoolers. So with that, creating that avenue of science enrichment, I purchased all of the stuff that would go with that as far as kits and reading material for students to have even on hand that we'd kind of get that cross curricular connection so that they could read historical stuff about forensics or biographies from forensics artists or forensic scientists. And so bought lots of stuff through that. And I also tried to look for things that I could also use in my classroom with limited time for labs, but you still want to give them that experience. So you try to find the materials that work best with not a crazy of time.

Daylene Long (05:59):

So for your summer forensics course, when do you start thinking about all the things you're going to need for that Course?

Kelda Bailess (06:08):

Usually now? Usually now I usually try to get all that. Yeah, I usually try to get all that done so that by say the spring ordering could happen. So everything is in for the camps in June and July.

Daylene Long (06:23):

Okay, so you're thinking about it now, it's kind of in the back of your head, it's what you might be wanting to get, and then by spring you have your order in and then you usually get it by June or July. When does your camp start? Is that early enough? Well, no, I get the stuff.

Kelda Bailess (06:42):

I try to get everything in by the end of May so that I have the materials for June and July

Daylene Long (06:50):

Before the end of June and then July. Yeah, That makes sense. And then do you remember with the forensic stuff, who was the last, where did you buy a lot of those materials?

Kelda Bailess (07:05):

Carolina.

Daylene Long (07:06):

Carolina. Okay. So

Kelda Bailess (07:08):

A lot of stuff from Carolina, biological logical plan, some of the extra things I get off of Amazon that are comparable to that I have

Daylene Long (07:26):

Going in the background. I apologize. So I'll mute on my side while you're talking.

Kelda Bailess (07:31):

Yeah.

Daylene Long (07:32):

So tell me what you remember buying from Carolina and Flan and Amazon. Just

Kelda Bailess (07:38):

How did you decide

Daylene Long (07:40):

What you were going to buy from

Kelda Bailess (07:41):

'Em? Right. Well, there are some like DNA kits, some bullet kits, different things like that so they can get experience with, what do you call it? Can't, sorry, I've been sick, so I can't really think. That's Okay. Let's see. Fingerprinting kits purchase. Let just start with the DNA kits. Where did you get those? From Carolina. From

Daylene Long (08:21):

Carolina, okay. Same with the fingerprinting kits?

Kelda Bailess (08:25):

Yeah, pretty much, yep. Okay.

Daylene Long (08:28):

And then do you remember anything else that you got from Carolina?

Kelda Bailess (08:35):

Let me think what else did I get? I got some, I'm trying to think of where the teacher, I think I got a couple teacher resource books there. I'm trying to see if it had my history up here in the past. Oh, I did buy owl pellets because that's a quick fun thing for students to do that they see something immediately. The microscopes we got were from Carolina. We bought probably over the past two years, we probably bought 25. Let's see, I'm trying to think of what the kits were exactly. Caroline, sorry. That's Okay. And just

Daylene Long (09:33):

A little bit too on what you bought from Flynn. I'm just kind of trying to understand in your mind how you decided you were going to get what from home.

Kelda Bailess (09:42):

Okay. So usually I look at trying to see who's got the best prices. Obviously if I have a budget then I'm wanting to get as much as I can. So I think with Flynn we bought some materials or lab equipment, stuff like some more beakers, some vials. And from Carolina I bought some models Like

Daylene Long (10:18):

Cellular models or

Kelda Bailess (10:21):

Models. So like some mitosis and meiosis, some DNA models, like a molecule of DNA. Let's see, I think most of the stuff though came from, I bought some cameras, some of the microscope. It is a microscope thing that has the big screen on the top. I think we got that from Flynn, but I would say a majority of the stuff comes from Carolina.

Daylene Long (11:03):

And then does your school have preferential vendors that they use or do you get to decide who you use or how does that

Kelda Bailess (11:13):

Work? Our school doesn't use Amazon, which kind of is difficult. So usually if I want something from there, I buy it myself. They don't

Daylene Long (11:28):

Do Why?

Kelda Bailess (11:30):

I think that in the past it was something to do with purchase orders, I'm not sure. But with, they've never had one that they've told me that I had to order from. Usually I kind of do the legwork myself and I reach out to create an account, make sure that they take purchase orders, what's the shipping? I like to go with the people. Carolina a lot of times will have lower shipping on things and the turnaround is pretty fast with Carolina, but they've not ever said other than Amazon that there was a place that I could not buy from. So when I went to the National Science Teacher Association conference, I go visit all kinds of places because I want to even bring things to our area that is not a common vendor, but they really, as long as we have stuff that is, I know one thing that I've run into, I wanted lab store for my students because our access to a working lab was very minimal. And so I did not ever get to purchase that before I left my other high school because I was running into, they wanted evidence-based, they want all kinds of extra documentation. Even though Stanford University created it, they couldn't find the right paperwork to, so they like to have things super documented that

Daylene Long (13:38):

Do you know what they're looking for? So I'm wondering why they didn't see what they needed to feel like it was. So do you have a sense of what they Right. They said

Kelda Bailess (13:56):

That I might actually pull up the email for that, but it was so to use Esser money on things they said that it needed, I kind of have, not just saying that it's the immediate effectiveness, but they wanted kind of a long term. They said there's a certain number that they look for. I mean, I printed out all kinds of data about the effectiveness of it.

Daylene Long (14:32):

That's fine.

Kelda Bailess (14:34):

You can pause. That's Okay. Hey, Sorry, I didn't know you were I'm That's fine. I'm sorry. I just, Okay. I'll come see as soon as I'm, Let's see. I can tell you that it said,

Daylene Long (14:55):

It sounds like you gave them a bunch of materials, but that for whatever reason it wasn't sufficient.

Kelda Bailess (15:01):

Right. I can't remember what the rating was, but it was, I'll tell you that the guy at lab store could not even understand why our district felt that it wasn't good enough.

Daylene Long (15:24):

Okay. Remind me what district

Kelda Bailess (15:28):

I'm in. Vicksburg Warren.

Daylene Long (15:29):

Okay. Vicksburg Warren School District. So I'm

Kelda Bailess (15:36):

Trying to see, I can't find it, but yeah, that's, I'm not sure. I can't remember what that was. And it may have just been because it was using Esser money.

Daylene Long (15:53):

Okay. That makes sense. And how did you want to use Lambster with your students?

Kelda Bailess (16:01):

Well, I wanted to use it be a resource I to give them more real world hands-on ish practice and so that they could see the relevance of the material that we were learning.

Daylene Long (16:25):

Okay. Are there any other kind of computer platform that you use alongside hands-on

Kelda Bailess (16:36):

For learning? No, I mean our district had the discovery Ed, what's the other one? Nearpod.

Daylene Long (16:52):

Okay.

Kelda Bailess (16:54):

Some of those like that. But I wanted it to be more of the virtual lab

Daylene Long (17:02):

To feel like they were in a virtual lab and understanding what might go on in that. But

Kelda Bailess (17:08):

What

Daylene Long (17:09):

Kind of hands-on activities do you do during a typical school year? When, let's put the forensics summer camp, which sounds super fun aside for a minute. And for your biology classes, what kind of hands-on activities do you?

Kelda Bailess (17:25):

Well, they do a lot of work with microscopes, so I do purchase lots of slides. The pre-made slides. They also make some slides, the tissue from the mouth, some of those we do osmosis with movement of materials across the membrane. What else have they done? They construct strands of DNA. We extract DNA, I'm trying to think. I mean trying to think of all the ones that we've done, but we do a lot. But then at the same time, without a huge lab, working lab and then longer class periods, it was difficult. You had to find things that worked in say, a 55 minute class instead of longer. But now the school that I'm at this year, their classes Are like an hour, nope, about two Hours, two or so. So that helps. And I'm over the science department, so I actually just had a meeting with all the science teachers last week and I'm like, what resources can I get for you? What are you seeing that you need? So I told them to try to compile a list because I want to make sure that they have whatever they feel they need to effectively teach the standards. So

Daylene Long (19:19):

Yeah. So a few questions popped into my head as you were talking.

Kelda Bailess (19:24):

If you

Daylene Long (19:25):

Have only a 55 minute class, and this helps product developers think of how big or small they should make and experience, how much of that would you want devoted to a hands-on lab? If it's lab day?

Kelda Bailess (19:48):

Well, I think that a 35 to 40 minute is good. That gives you time for a hook, introducing it, getting, and then at the end it's a time to share out or give some results. Could possibly 45 minutes would possibly work.

Daylene Long (20:17):

And then for The, Sorry,

Kelda Bailess (20:20):

Do what? Yeah. And then if it's a longer activity, if it's something that can be separated by days, then that's fine too. We've done the Wisconsin fast plants and that worked well doing that in segments. Yeah.

Daylene Long (20:43):

Okay. That makes sense. And then, let's see,

Kelda Bailess (20:48):

Oh,

Daylene Long (20:48):

You talked about that you are asking people to start thinking about what they need and what physical tools did they need to do that? I'm trying to see what a vendor could supply you. Do they use the catalog or past pos helpful electronic wishlists, Excel spreadsheets. How do they usually

Kelda Bailess (21:13):

Do

Daylene Long (21:13):

This? So

Kelda Bailess (21:14):

I love electronic wishlists. I've found that those are super effective and it's pretty easy to print those off or add to them.

Daylene Long (21:32):

Are there any vendors That use that Well that do the electronic wishlist? Well,

Kelda Bailess (21:38):

Yeah, I mean Carolina's is pretty efficient. All

Daylene Long (21:42):

Right.

Kelda Bailess (21:44):

And as far as catalog? Not really because I think that there's a lot of extra that I'm not even going to look at. So to me, it's a waste of trees. And I mean, I'm not a tree hugger, but I also don't like to have it lying around because I already have so much other stuff.

Kelda Bailess (22:13):

So online where I can type it in and I can just say forensics and it, it has those keywords of things that are connected to that. Because when I just say go on a website to search for a product, I like it when there's other things that I might not have remembered or thought of, but because it has that keyword connected to it, it's going to pop up and I'm going to be like, oh yeah, I could use that. That's a great idea. Or I could put that kit in there and I didn't even realize. So it kind of works out as something a little bit more effective.

Daylene Long (22:53):

That sounds smart. Sounds like a smart way to approach it. Are there any vendors that you think do a really good job of that?

Kelda Bailess (23:04):

Amazon? No,

Daylene Long (23:07):

Amazon is pretty good at that.

Kelda Bailess (23:09):

Yeah. Any

Daylene Long (23:10):

Life science vendors that you can think of that do a good job of that?

Kelda Bailess (23:14):

Carolina does do okay with that.

Daylene Long (23:19):

What could they do better?

Kelda Bailess (23:27):

I think have more reviews from people that have used it. I think maybe encourage teachers to actually add a review, find some way to encourage people leave the review. Maybe it's 5% off next time or it's something I don't know because I really, when I'm looking on Facebook science groups, science teacher groups, I appreciate having the feedback from other teachers who've done lessons before or who've gone to these different sites.

Daylene Long (24:08):

That makes a lot of sense. Like HGMI, different

Kelda Bailess (24:13):

Websites to look for resources. I like to see the ones who've actually used it. It kind of pushes me to go, oh well 10 of those people would just like their comment. They must have used it before. Let me go see kind of thing.

Daylene Long (24:32):

Okay. I think that's a good idea. And then you mentioned Facebook communities. Which ones do you participate?

Kelda Bailess (24:41):

A lot of 'em.

Daylene Long (24:43):

There's a lot of 'em out there now.

Kelda Bailess (24:46):

There are a lot of 'em And

Daylene Long (24:48):

Some of 'em

Kelda Bailess (24:49):

Really

Daylene Long (24:49):

Good.

Kelda Bailess (24:51):

Let's see, I was trying to see which ones the Nng SS Biology teachers. That's a really good one. I'm trying to see which all the biology corner,

Daylene Long (25:11):

Just even your favorites.

Kelda Bailess (25:16):

So the Biology corner and the NGSS one is probably the one that I use the most.

Daylene Long (25:22):

Okay.

Kelda Bailess (25:24):

Yeah.

Daylene Long (25:24):

Okay, that's helpful. Let's see. So we were talking about how you get your lists and you talked a little bit about maybe if somebody left the review that they might get some sort of a little perk for it.

Kelda Bailess (25:41):

Just

Daylene Long (25:41):

In general, what are some of the favorite

Kelda Bailess (25:44):

Perks that you get

Daylene Long (25:45):

From vendors?

Kelda Bailess (25:50):

Well, I don't think there's a lot of perks. Are you asking what we could get as perks?

Daylene Long (25:54):

Sure.

Kelda Bailess (25:56):

I think that shipping is always a good thing. I know that I used to heavily buy from school specialty because they would give after or they would give 10% off or something like that for being a teacher instead of just somebody that's happened upon their site or I don't know if you threw in a sample of a kit or something like that. Maybe teachers love free things. When I go to the science conferences, the national ones, I usually, I love the free stuff, but then I come home and I order for my students. So I think that free things

Daylene Long (26:58):

And when the customer service is, sorry,

Kelda Bailess (27:03):

When the customer service is good, where you have either you can chat with somebody pretty quickly or the response time to an email is quick. I think that makes a lot of difference. I know I've left, I've not gotten great customer service from things I've bought whether personally or for school and the customer service just was not good. And so I didn't buy again.

Daylene Long (27:33):

Yeah. So can you think of an instance when you were buying for school that happened when the customer service just wasn't good? No,

Kelda Bailess (27:44):

I can't remember what the company was and something came in broken. And I love that I can just reach out to somebody and say, but then when it's questioning or they're wanting you to send the broken thing back and then they'll replace it. I'm like, I can send you pictures right now, but for me to go to the post office is there's not a lot of time in the day. So I just want good customer service, prompt feedback, or if I have questions about how to use something, it'd be great to have somebody that I could chat online with or videos on how to, because a lot of times instructions that come in as easy to understand. So sometimes we need some PD on it.

Daylene Long (28:44):

Yeah. So the videos, do you want those for teachers, students? Both.

Kelda Bailess (28:54):

I would say that I would say teachers because those teachers, because then we can know, we can learn it ourself and then at least we'll look more efficient. It looks like we know what we're talking about. Is

Daylene Long (29:13):

There anything that would make you throw your hands in the air and say, I'm done with that vendor. I'm going to start looking for a new one

Kelda Bailess (29:24):

If the prices aren't even comparable to others or if the shipping takes forever? Yeah, I think those are the two of the main things.

Daylene Long (29:35):

So pricing, obviously, because you need to have a responsibility to your school and the shipping issue. Is that, do you need it by a certain date for a lab or tell me what's the most,

Kelda Bailess (29:51):

Maybe. I guess we've all gotten used to the quickness of Amazon or something like that. So when something's going to take four weeks, it's like why? I don't understand. So I mean, I guess that they have to come from another continent. I don't know. But I think that promptness to get supplies is a good thing. And then, what was I going to say? Oh, I can't remember. I lost my train of thought.

Daylene Long (30:34):

Okay. Let me just flip down to the rest of these questions then.

Kelda Bailess (30:42):

Let's go back to

Daylene Long (30:44):

Your activities for the summer, the forensics activities,

Kelda Bailess (30:49):

Did you have a pre-established budget for that or was that a separate grant? How did that work? Yeah, it was a budget. So it is through the Army Educational Outreach program. So they have a budget, and I try to also purchase things that are going to last. And I think that as teachers, we get something and we want to try to make it as useful as possible for the longest amount of time. So if it comes as it's going to a kit is going to be good for 30 students, so then I can put 'em in groups and make that last for another time. Do remember? Yeah, I had set budgets. Do you remember approximately what those budgets were for

Daylene Long (31:50):

The forensics plan? Yeah,

Kelda Bailess (31:52):

It's usually 3000 ish. For each camp I had two, and so I had two camps.

Daylene Long (32:02):

And then at the current school that you're at, what is for your core life science courses, what is your budget on an annual basis? Usually run there.

Kelda Bailess (32:18):

I mean, it could be. I really don't know the exact budget. I do know that the academy that I'm over, we have an annual budget of about $10,000.

Daylene Long (32:36):

And does that Cover All your life sciences or all your courses? Science courses in general?

Kelda Bailess (32:42):

All the science in general. And then of course we have Esser money still because of the covid thing. And so that's why I've encouraged my teachers to let me know what you need because that money's going to go to somebody. It might as well go to us. Yeah,

Daylene Long (33:04):

Exactly. Okay. So just a couple more questions and then I'll bring Kim in to see if he has any, do you have any vendors that you would say that you are loyal to

Kelda Bailess (33:24):

Carolina?

Daylene Long (33:27):

And remind me again, I know you mentioned a couple reasons that you feel that way towards Carolina, but how would you kind of sum that up? What makes you loyal to 'em?

Kelda Bailess (33:41):

Their shipping is quick and it's usually, unless it's some big thing, then it's usually free. Their website is easy to access.

Daylene Long (33:58):

Okay. Those are helpful. And let me see, I think that covers my main questions. Kimberly,

Kelda Bailess (34:10):

Would you like

Daylene Long (34:11):

To join us and do you have any questions for Kelda

Kimberly Herder (34:18):

One or coming from the classroom and now, excuse me, in an administration, but in the classroom, what was your process of differentiation? Or did you really, was that a concern?

Kelda Bailess (34:35):

De definitely was a concern. So you're talking about differentiating my lessons for students.

Kelda Bailess (34:44):

So a lot of times I found that some of the kits that I got from Carolina were a little too difficult for students, so it took extra time for me to go figure out how I could break that down for other students, but not make it seem to the class that they were doing something different. So materials that were differentiated already would be awesome, or if you could have, I know with kits you get a booklet of instructions or printables, and if it could be like, here's the way you could take these same materials and drop this down a level, or here's a way that you could use it for enrichment, make it a little bit tougher, a little bit more of a challenge. I think that would be a good idea. Did

Daylene Long (35:44):

Those things ever come up in your Facebook communities where somebody says, Hey, I'm doing this lab. How would you differentiate the instruction or how would you provide extra, what's the word, Kim, where you

Kimberly Herder (35:59):

Well, enrichment For making Scaffold.

Kelda Bailess (36:03):

Scaffold, the lessons it has come up, I have seen those discussions and tons of teachers give feedback on it, which it's good because I've read some things and said, oh, well, with osmosis or something, oh, I could do that. I could do the gummy bear thing, or that would make it easier for our students who are so behind to understand. So yeah, those questions do definitely come up and people give feedback, so I love reading those from the Facebook community.

Daylene Long (36:49):

Okay. You mentioned your students are behind. Tell me a little bit about what your assessments look like for science.

Kelda Bailess (36:58):

Well, I've usually, if it is just a formative assessment, I create those maybe on my own. Sometimes I'll take questions from a testing bank that we have, but a lot of our summatives come from Mastery Connect, what our district uses for benchmark tests. So I do love a test item bank

Daylene Long (37:32):

Called Mastery Connect. Is that what you said?

Kelda Bailess (37:35):

Yes. And

Daylene Long (37:37):

Then do you have state testing for science? Do they have to

Kelda Bailess (37:42):

For biology? Yes, for

Daylene Long (37:43):

Biology. Okay.

Kelda Bailess (37:45):

Okay.

Daylene Long (37:45):

And how do you prep kids for those?

Kelda Bailess (37:50):

Okay, so I've also used Enrichment Plus if I have one in here, that's a company in Georgia that creates workbooks that go with our Mississippi State testing and those, I've been able to let my students do the practice test. I usually do this when we're really into the state test prep mode and it has a practice test and my students go through and they work on that practice test, then they self grade, and if they've missed question number one, then it says, you need to go work on standard whatever, or you need to go work on this standard. And so my students, their test prep is differentiated because if they already know the content, then they're not going to have to go back and relearn it, and I don't have to go back and reteach it to that group of kids. Yeah,

Daylene Long (38:50):

That's

Kelda Bailess (38:51):

Cool. Yeah. Enrichment Plus is good with that. Masteryconnect, I'll take the benchmark tests that our district has. They create them from MasteryConnect. I'll take those benchmarks and I'll pull those tests up. I usually look at which test questions say 45% or more of my students have missed. And then I pull out those questions and we go through those questions and I said, I try to figure out what are the misconceptions to that question, because once you go through that and you hear your students say, oh, well I just read that fast, or I didn't read that word correctly, I thought that said this or that, showing them how they think or what happens when they're reading too fast. It also lets me see the mistakes they make so often and then I can adjust my teaching to that To make sure that I hit those things.

Daylene Long (40:07):

The one thing I didn't ask you is you've got an opportunity to talk directly to the product development teams right now. So what do you feel is missing that you would love to see some company, any company develop for teachers or students?

Kelda Bailess (40:43):

I mean, I think we're drowning in virtual games. I think that, so that would not be one because students a lot of times don't take it too serious.

Daylene Long (41:01):

And

Kelda Bailess (41:01):

Then, I don't know, I don't want to focus just on the testing, but one thing I would like to see is more focus put on life science vocabulary with my students. I teach them prefixes and suffixes, and I start at the very beginning. So I'm old school and do notebooks and they use colored ink because the color, it's going to make it stick in your brain. Writing it out is way better than taking digital notes. And they see that once they get to the end of the year, but I make them have a part of their notebook that sectioned off for their vocabulary or their glossary define. We don't go through and say, okay, now define this list of words. But as we go through them when we're learning content, we always hit on those prefixes and suffixes and drilling that in. Then when they approach test questions or essays or anything like that with that in there, then they have a good foundation to figure out what they're trying to read or what they're trying to understand. But I would say that so many of our kids have gotten the short end of the stick with labs. I think virtual labs is a great idea if you're in a position where you can't go to a lab or if you don't have time. But I would like it to be more rigorous than a kid game.

Daylene Long (43:02):

Okay. So you mentioned that the term drowning in games and that the kids don't take seriously,

Kelda Bailess (43:13):

But you are interested in something that is

Daylene Long (43:15):

More like a simulation of a real scientific,

Kelda Bailess (43:22):

I think that if it took on a whole look of something more professional instead of cartoons like cartoon characters and things like that, I think if it gave that feel of, oh my gosh, this is almost like this is so lifelike, this is more like what we see on Grey's Anatomy. This looks like you're right there at that surgery and you're able to manipulate tools. I think they would take it more seriously.

Daylene Long (43:55):

Okay. That's really interesting. I know you got lots going on. I see people coming and going and your phone ringing and all that other kind of stuff. Kim, do you want to do a little wrap up for us and tell Kelda what to expect next?

Kimberly Herder (44:15):

So first, thank you.

Kelda Bailess (44:17):

This has been fantastic, and

Kimberly Herder (44:21):

I'm sorry you're not in the classroom anymore, but you're going to be, I'm sure the teachers that you influence now are

Kelda Bailess (44:29):

I told 'em to please let me come team teach at some point because I do love the classroom 21 years in the classroom. Well, you're going to get

Kimberly Herder (44:42):

An email from me, excuse me this afternoon that's going to have a couple things on it that one of 'em will be, if you think of anything, whether it's today, tomorrow, the next week, something like that, my email will be there and please let me know. And then also if you would consider perhaps being involved in research projects in the future. So just let me know that.

Kelda Bailess (45:11):

Okay. I can let you know through that. Okay.

Kimberly Herder (45:13):

Yep.

Kelda Bailess (45:13):

Alright.

Daylene Long (45:14):

You'll get your gift card today. I usually do them at the end of the day when everybody's kind of wrapped up, it'll give you a choice of a Visa gift card or a Target gift card or there's a few different things that you can choose from. That's good. And I wanted to tell you too, that learning prefixes and suffixes in my biology class when I was in high school has last

Kelda Bailess (45:43):

Me

Daylene Long (45:43):

A lifetime. You use those things for when you go to the doctor, you use those things when you're trying to understand scientific tests. So I wanted to

Kelda Bailess (45:55):

Thank

Daylene Long (45:55):

You for teaching students that you're giving them a gift does last a lifetime.

Kelda Bailess (46:00):

Well, thank you. You're

Daylene Long (46:01):

Welcome. And the other thing I was going to tell you too is as a marketer, I have to convince people that using color makes it stick in your brain more. So I just love it when you said that as a teacher that

Kelda Bailess (46:12):

That's the

Daylene Long (46:13):

Reason you do it because it does psychologically, it makes it sticky. So I

Kelda Bailess (46:18):

Appreciate it. And that's what I tell 'em when in doubt. When in doubt draw it out. So we draw and I buy tons of, I should have stock in flare pans.

Daylene Long (46:31):

Oh yeah.

Kelda Bailess (46:32):

Yeah. And so I tell my students, even when I go to church or anything, my notes are usually very colorful because it makes it stick. And with my A DHD, I don't get bored with it,

Kimberly Herder (46:52):

So

Kelda Bailess (46:53):

It's two for one. Well, thank you again so much. You're part of our community now, so if you ever get an idea, I

Daylene Long (47:01):

Really wish a vendor would know this. I really wish a big company would know this. Feel free to reach out. We work with a variety of different clients and we're happy to pass those messages along for you and just stay in touch. We'll

Kelda Bailess (47:17):

Keep

Daylene Long (47:17):

Your email and if you want to connect with me on, I'm on LinkedIn and Twitter professionally.

Kelda Bailess (47:26):

Okay. I'm on

Daylene Long (47:28):

Facebook too, but you're going to get a lot of pictures of my golden retriever, so there's that.

Kelda Bailess (47:34):

Well, I have A golden doodle, so.

Daylene Long (47:37):

Oh, those are so cute.

Kelda Bailess (47:39):

Yeah.

Daylene Long (47:39):

Okay. Well, thank you so much. Thank you again for your time.

Kelda Bailess (47:43):

Yes, thank you.

Daylene Long (47:51):

Kim. I'm going to continue to record for a little bit since we didn't get to go through your summary at the beginning of her interview, so I was hoping you could just kind of run us through that and 20 years, I'm trying to figure out if she's a millennial or a Gen X. She has

Kimberly Herder (48:10):

A 17-year-old son.

Daylene Long (48:14):

She's probably Gen

Kimberly Herder (48:20):

Xp.

Daylene Long (48:21):

Okay. And then she mentioned her district. And that's in Mississippi or Missouri?

Kimberly Herder (48:29):

Mississippi. She's in Vicksburg, Mississippi. And it's, well, I have to look up what county it is again. It's Warren Central High School.

Daylene Long (48:41):

Okay. Warren Central High School. No, it's Warren. It's Warren slash Vicksburg County

Kimberly Herder (48:49):

School District. Yeah.

Daylene Long (48:51):

And then you mentioned some of her professional things that she did outside. Do you want to just give us a summary of those?

Kimberly Herder (48:58):

Yes. So she came before she was the vice or Yeah, the assistant principal at Warren Central, which is a school that has ACTE STEM, CTE and STEM Academies, and she does the science academy. She was at River City Early College High School, and she was there for seven years and was the biology teacher and science chair. She is, yes. The deputy county coroner. And she's been doing that for about 10 years it looks like.

Daylene Long (49:41):

I really wanted to ask her more about that, but that wasn't part of our research

Kimberly Herder (49:46):

And

Daylene Long (49:47):

She clearly had a busy office and I didn't want to take up her time with that. But it did sound really interesting.

Kimberly Herder (49:56):

Their biomed school, which we didn't ask and I should have thought about that too, they consider is get CTE funding. And it's because of the three-year pathway that they have, or at least they have listed PLTW. So whether she was not PLTW at her old one, but the school is listed as PLTW, biomed CTE,

Daylene Long (50:23):

Which,

Kimberly Herder (50:24):

So

Daylene Long (50:25):

Yeah. And she mentioned that their annual budget was 10,000, which is on the higher end for a school. So I don't know if that's because she's combining the CTE money or not. Okay. Anything else we should have in our notes for Matt and I will stop recording?

Kimberly Herder (50:46):

No. Yeah, that she's currently and now the assistant principal. Okay.

Daylene Long (50:50):

I'm going to stop recording and then I've got a couple other things for you. I.

Daylene Long (00:02):

I am going to go ahead and just turn my thing off and admit him and let you take it from there. Is that okay?

Kimberly Herder (00:09):

Sure. Or do

Daylene Long (00:09):

You want me to do it differently? Okay. Well, unless you just want to introduce it. Yeah, I can do that. Okay. Okay.

Kimberly Herder (00:17):

Ready? Okay.

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (00:32):

Ah, cat. Hello.

Daylene Long (00:36):

That was funny because good timing. I've been doing that through many of these sessions where my cat's tail just kind of goes like this through it and I'm thinking, oh man, somebody's going to watch this video and think I have no control of my office because I don't, the cat has control.

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (00:53):

It's the cat's place really. I have cats. I'm a biology teacher. I have, how am I doing this? Bearded dragons over here. There's animals all around.

Daylene Long (01:03):

Yeah. I call my cat the office insubordinate. She'll not do anything that I tell her to do.

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (01:11):

Perfect.

Daylene Long (01:13):

It's very nice to meet you. I wanted to let you know we are recording this. It's just so I've got notes. I promise you won't end up on YouTube and I'm not going to ask you to do a TikTok dance. We might ask your cat to do a TikTok dance, but

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (01:27):

That's fair.

Daylene Long (01:30):

And I'm actually going to go off camera and I'm going to turn it over to Kimberly who's got a bunch of questions for you.

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (01:37):

Perfect. All

Daylene Long (01:38):

Right, sounds good. So we're recording and Kim, you're on.

Kimberly Herder (01:43):

Okay. Well, may I call you Greg? You can call me Kim. Yes. Okay.

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (01:47):

Hi Kim. Alright,

Kimberly Herder (01:50):

Well first thank you for doing this. It both means a lot to Daylene and myself and the company that there's teachers that professionals that step up to be part of surveys, but it's important to our client. So what's your cat's name?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (02:09):

I actually have two cats

Kimberly Herder (02:11):

And they are both

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (02:12):

Very happy that I'm home. So this is very nerdy. This is thiamine, and then Adine is currently nearby. I'm a biology teacher, so those are two of the bases for DNA. So I call them Addie and Tai.

Kimberly Herder (02:27):

Very nice, very nice. Very clever and very nice.

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (02:31):

Yes.

Kimberly Herder (02:34):

Or I'm going to ask you questions that get into the how and why you've purchased different things or thought about things or involved in different ways that would in the classroom and with your students on how you buy things, how you decide what you're going to teach. All of those go through that part of it. The questions maybe you're going to might think that or maybe a little bit silly because we're going to try to get back into actually the thought process of why you chose to teach certain things or do certain things or how that happens. So we can get a timeline as to the whole process on how the teacher, I'm still here, don't

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (03:24):

Worry. Oh, sorry. It's just for whatever reason, the USB is a little bit loose. I'm still here. Yes.

Kimberly Herder (03:30):

Okay. Okay. So that's what that's we're going to do. But first I'm going to have you talk a little bit about your background and why you're doing that sort of thing, but I have to disclose that my youngest son went to Northwestern about the same age as you. So I don't know if you were a wildcat as well. I

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (03:52):

Was not. I went to U Chicago.

Kimberly Herder (03:54):

Oh, okay. Well, I know that really well as well because I Yes, stayed downtown often when I go to visit him and he's actually moving back to, sorry, now I got totally distracted. He's moving back to Chicago from Portland. I'm in Portland the 4th of January. Yeah. So anyway, I'll be back there again, but love Evanston and know exactly whose School is

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (04:20):

Wow kids. Yeah.

Kimberly Herder (04:22):

There we go. There we go.

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (04:24):

I literally just came from work. Yeah. Yes. Excellent. Cool. We have a connection then.

Kimberly Herder (04:30):

Yes, absolutely. So if you can tell me a minute or two about why you're doing what you're doing, who you are, why you're doing what you're doing.

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (04:41):

Sure. So I'm Greg Strom. I am a high school biology teacher and starting next year I'm also a zoology teacher. I'm going to be having an elective. I'm very excited for it. I'm a PhD dropout. I was the person who was like, oh, everyone's telling me that I want to get my PhD and I'm just going to go along in the path. And I didn't fall out of love with science. I fell out of love with the business of science and really, really intense research and I was just doing a lot of reflection on what I got out of science and how much I enjoyed it. And it all really came back to teachers. So I just really wanted to contribute back into that system if I myself couldn't go through a PhD, but if I inspired one student in my years to get one, cool. If I do two, I've doubled myself. So I just really think that when it comes to science education in particular, there's such a need for experiential teaching and experiential learning. There's a lot of interesting ways to teach science and I'm one of those people who likes to work with the hands-on approach rather than the, I tell you things. I would rather that the kids discover stuff. So that's where I'm really coming from with things in bio.

Kimberly Herder (05:59):

Very cool. How long have you been teaching? This

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (06:02):

Is my seventh year.

Kimberly Herder (06:05):

And you've been at the same high school?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (06:08):

Yes, I've been at Evanston Township High School for seven years, and prior to that, this is my 10th year in education. I was a para before when I was still, after I left my PhD program, I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do and I conveniently contacted one of my old high school teachers and that led to a pair position at my old high school.

Kimberly Herder (06:27):

Cool. Those connections, those connections mean a lot.

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (06:31):

They mean a lot to everybody. I'm sure they meant a lot. You meant a lot to them too

Kimberly Herder (06:35):

For them to thank you. So I'm just going to jump right in and talk about buying experiences or first in your curriculum and what you do. Okay, so you're doing experimental hands-on learning. How do you start that process?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (06:57):

I start that process by asking the students. So I present the students with something interesting, or at least what I think is interesting, something that I hope is going to cause 'em to ask a lot of questions. And then it's designing stuff around those questions. Now, granted being a sneaky teacher, I know what their questions are going to be. So one of the phenomenon that I selected, for example, is cancer. So it's not a happy thing, but it evokes interest and that for the most part, I know what your average 14, 15-year-old is going to be asking about that disease and what they want to know. So once I get those questions, that's what I start with. Whenever I'm working off of designing or working with or deciding what I'm going to be using and purchasing in materials is to see if those are things that are going to directly lead to an experience to my students being able to answer those questions that they have as scientists.

Kimberly Herder (07:53):

I'm going to ask you two questions on that one. When you come up with your ideas for them, are they standards based or do you truly just say, let's do cancer?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (08:07):

I look at the NJSS standards and there's a bunch, there's just a giant list essentially of main learning targets that we have to go through and I take a look at them and I think, okay, if I was an average 14, 16-year-old and I had to learn mi posis, so that's specifically for this cancer thing, it's like I have to learn mi ptosis. Alright. I personally as a bio teacher, barely care about mitosis. So that's just my opinion. So how can I make them want to like it? How can I make them to want to know how cells divide? Well it turns out that what's just using my knowledge and my background information, I reason oh well is so it's really two options. It's either healing from injury or rapid cell growth, which is cancer. I've tended to find that students have a much more personal connection when it comes to cancer and that has ultimately resulted in that being the most thoughtful thing.

Kimberly Herder (09:10):

Okay, makes total sense. And I applaud you for it. I want to be in your class. Thank you. So alright, so you decided now you're going to teach mitosis through cancer. What do you do? Yeah, what do you do next? I

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (09:34):

Get students to ask questions and then I gather those questions and then I as the teacher am trying to find materials and it's just things that I can utilize in some way to help guide students through what we call an NGSS, like the storyline that ideally they're going through and developing the story and ultimately at the end they're figuring out what is cancer, how does it work, kind of thing. So that's the next step is any number of things. And realistically, every year I try different things to see what works best. I've tried this and that and starting with this and trying this approach because realistically you can come at it from all different directions and it's partially influenced by the students that year. Sometimes every so often there's a little bit of change or there's something topical, but by and large I'm looking for stuff that hopefully gets that answered their questions.

Kimberly Herder (10:29):

So where do you get that stuff? Is it like kits? Where do you get it?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (10:34):

I feel like I have put my hands in everything at this point. So I'm part of, there's websites that I go to as of this year. I don't ignore chat GPT for a little bit of help for ideas and stuff. I'm part of social media groups. My school utilizes the Miller Libby Bubble Bee book to see if there's anything in there. I just look for everything for inspiration. But as I'm probably filled out in the survey, I ultimately will end up taking that stuff and making it my own regardless. It's just, I suppose the way that I'm structured as a type A person, but it's like, oh, but I really need to make this specific for me and my kids. I need to put my own voice into it and getting ideas and maybe data and then being where I got a credit from kind of thing, but trying to synthesize things together I suppose.

Kimberly Herder (11:37):

So what are some of those, if you'd share some of those websites or social media, where do you go and why do you trust them or do you trust them? Well, you must, if you go to them,

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (11:50):

I trust them as a starting point. I trust them as maybe like an idea bank. Honestly, the Facebook groups have some of the most influential things, which is really cool. It's just seeing what other people are doing. I trust them in the sense that it's other biology teachers, they're doing things. I'm not naive to the fact that there are biology teachers who teach very boringly and quite plainly, but I am still able to get inspired by those things and then utilize that to try to construct my own thing, I suppose.

Kimberly Herder (12:28):

Is there a particular Facebook group that you like?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (12:34):

There's one that's literally just called NGSS biology teachers, and then I've also pulled some from the Illinois storylines by Dr. Jason Green. He's just cool and I happen to be friends with his friends. I suppose just someone who's really, really good at Storylining, I think I'm decent at it, but he's really good at going into the full on pedagogy and really getting into the nitty gritty of it, the documentation and stuff and just that stuff. And then in terms of other places for inspiration, literally publications like actual written research that I feel like I could try to translate for students, I suppose it just really depends on what their questions are, I guess.

Kimberly Herder (13:24):

So you've done that part well first actually, can you in a sentence or two say what for our note purposes, so I don't put words in your mouth, what storylining is?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (13:36):

Storylining to me is starting with a phenomenon and then giving students a driving question and students are interested in answering that question and they travel through a unit in which it's a story-like concept in that it's all linked together and ultimately at the end of it they can look back and see all the things that they've done. So every lesson is leading into the other one as fluidly as you can, or at least is definitely answering a bunch of questions that's leading to more questions so that ultimately they're able to frame and look back at their journey that they've made through discovery.

Kimberly Herder (14:13):

Do you do labs as part of this?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (14:17):

Yes, absolutely. I try to do labs as much as possible or activities. I feel like in bio compared to most sciences, a lot of stuff ends up being maybe not wet lab, but can still be something with manipulatives or sorting or cards or what have you kind of thing.

Kimberly Herder (14:39):

Where do you get the things for your labs?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (14:43):

I purchase lab supplies. Sometimes it's from local places, like I'll go to the grocery store or Dollar Tree. Literally. One of the reasons why I'm a little bit late is because I went to Dollar Tree to pick up some things because doing a lab experience ish tomorrow and I came up with the idea today, of course I will also order or I'll get a lot of stuff from Home Depot and Lowe's, honestly, because plants and stuff. But in terms of science equipment, largely Flynn, Carolina Biological Supply, and I really think those are the big two I and really maybe just some frivolous things from Amazon. I feel like that's lately been my main science equipment stuffs.

Kimberly Herder (15:37):

How do you pay for those?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (15:40):

In my school we have either, if it's through Amazon, it's a business account that we use, so we have our own login for that and then my boss approves it. And then business department, if it's stuff that I go and do the shopping myself, I just get the receipt, I have a tax exempt card, I get the receipt and then I get reimbursed after I submit it to my office, to my science department chair. We're a really big school, so I have the, A portion I immediately report to is in charge of 40 science teachers. And if I order it from Flynn or Carolina, I put in a request with our department administrative assistant and then they order it for me.

Kimberly Herder (16:26):

Do you have a budget?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (16:28):

I think I do. I'm very fortunate that I'm at a very well-resourced school. I have not yet been told that I have been doing too much. I tend to be very responsible. I am always very cognizant of what I'm spending and I don't want to ever want to overdo it. Some teachers are not that way apparently from what I've heard, but at least for me, my boss has always just been like, thank you, I suppose. And that's also with the book, we have a book that is technically a, it's not lab supply, it's a resource. We got together as a department and then I was on the three teachers I guess that were making the decision ultimately what book we were going to use and that was also paid by the school kind of thing. So

Kimberly Herder (17:20):

That's a textbook that you kind of go by.

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (17:23):

It's a textbook that I have that I have as a resource, to be honest, textbooks aren't really storyline ish just by nature. They are a document full of facts, no's, no experience there. They might start with a question, but then they just immediately answer the question. So it's a great resource for students to be able to go back to, or it might be something that I can utilize students miss a day and it's something that's just there if needed, if I need a floor for the student. But otherwise it is a reference more so than something that I absolutely go chapter by chapter kind of thing. Okay.

Kimberly Herder (18:06):

I'm going to jump back for a minute that you said that you think about Flynn Carolina and there was a ward I think you said or something. Anyway, what Do you like that is in

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (18:17):

There? That's good. Yeah, I didn't say that one, but I do order from Ward too.

Kimberly Herder (18:23):

How do you use them or how do you decide you're going to do, do you have a catalog? I mean, when you're kind of brainstorming your ideas and then you say, oh, I'll look at or what do you

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (18:35):

Yeah, I'll be honest. So let's see. I think over my years, some of the labs that I have, I've made myself out of my own knowledge from undergrad in grad school. They're labs that I myself did in high school or they're labs that I asked someone for. I saw that they were setting it up and I was like, Ooh, what are you doing over there? Kind of thing. It's like interdepartmental sharing or it is a lab that I just found and I was like, this is the coolest thing ever. I'd like to try this. And then it's trying to figure out like, okay, they use Petri dishes or pipettes or I have basic supplies, but what unique things do I need to find? I'd like to do a terrarium lab, so I need to go over to Target and get a bunch of containers that can act as terrariums. And then I got to go over here and I got to get which soil do I need to get? And just experimenting with stuff I suppose.

Kimberly Herder (19:30):

Would you like those things to be in a kit? Would you be a kit teacher?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (19:36):

It would be convenient if that was available. I feel like sometimes teachers, at least I statements, I as a teacher tend to do such personalized things that I almost screw myself over by doing that because I make it so personalized that kits can't possibly apply to me. And I've tried to make my life easier by being a little bit more flexible. But I would be open to the idea of if it was like I would like to do a terrarium, could there be a kit that I could purchase and just Hello Cat? And just getting them delivered at once would be super convenient because no, it's not my favorite part of my day. Going out after work and then going to Home Depot and then finding out that I also have to go to Lowe's and then finding out that I also have to go to the other Home Depot. I'd rather not spend my time after school getting lab supplies, but that's just kind of how it works at my

Kimberly Herder (20:30):

School. Sorry, this seems like getting into the weeds, but our client is trying to figure out what teachers, and particularly younger teachers, how they make those decisions. So that is where would you, if you were going to say, okay, oh, I want to see if there's a kit out there for terrariums, and where would

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (20:55):

Would I look if I wanted to see if there was a kit for Terrariums, I feel like I would throw it into Google,

Kimberly Herder (21:09):

Which

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (21:09):

Is probably not the best answer, but at least for as a younger teacher, I tend to find that, well, I guess I don't think of Flynn or other places as having kits or maybe I just haven't explored it as much. Oh, Carolina definitely has kids. Yeah. Yeah, Caroline has tons of kits and I should be better at that, but not, I feel like, yeah, I would end up typing it into Google because it isn't necessarily something, at least in that particular case, it isn't necessarily something that's exclusive to education. So there's a lot of citizen science and popular science stuff that we ended up doing in the classroom. But I suppose if we were reframing your question into something that was very specifically like an education thing, I guess I would end up wandering. I would be in Flynn and Carolina and stuff, just being like, what's here?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (22:05):

Is there something, I would love it if there was just a straight up, here's all of these. Do you want to do more labs? Well, here's some great lab ideas, because sometimes I'm like, I don't do enough labs and I wish I had more labs, but I don't know of more labs. And if there was just a giant inventory and I could be like, that one goes with, as someone who does their own curriculum being like, that would go perfectly with my cancer unit or that would go perfectly with my poison dart frog unit, which I have, or my disease unit, I guess that would be, I guess that would actually be very useful. I end up just finding pieces all over the place,

Kimberly Herder (22:50):

And again, I'm going to come back. But that would be related to standard space or does Illinois have a state test?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (23:01):

Illinois has a science test that students take when they're juniors or something, but it's not something that we teach to.

Kimberly Herder (23:11):

Okay. So

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (23:13):

We are NGSS people. We just have end next generation science standards.

Kimberly Herder (23:19):

Okay. All right. Let me, okay, but if you were to go out, okay, so for the lab equipment you do have, I mean, do you have probes, do you have beakers, that kind of stuff? If you need to replace them or you need to get them, where would you go?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (23:36):

My department secretary usually, and she is very much our, because she is a person who orders for 40 different teachers.

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (23:51):

This just happened last week. I needed to replace my Petri dishes. I had just done a lab and I needed to order more Petri dishes. And I walked up to her and I was just like, I need to order more of these. Which companies that again, which one is the one that people tend to use? And then she goes, oh, we usually get those from Flynn. I go, oh, of course, from Flynn. Duh. So she just kind of has that expertise. And she's also the one who is much more familiar with, or she is not only more familiar, she literally has the catalogs and she's a younger person too, I would say she's in her mid thirties. She has physical catalogs as well as just all the bookmarked different websites, and she's my touchpoint.

Kimberly Herder (24:42):

Okay, okay. I'm just trying to figure out how to frame it a little bit. So I'm still thinking about, okay, we're going on the timeline from, okay, cancer sounds good, we're going to do this, I'm going to need to, I'm doing my storyline, I'm going to do these certain things. The next step is probably when you get the Petri dishes or you get other things, do you then access worksheets or a video or what's kind of the next stage, next part of the process in your classroom?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (25:32):

For the planning element or for what I'm actually doing in the lesson?

Kimberly Herder (25:35):

Probably both.

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (25:43):

So is this hypothetically if I was doing a new lab and what resources I'm using kind of thing,

Kimberly Herder (25:50):

I'm thinking about things that you've done. So do you use videos? Did they come with the Petri dishes or did they have access because you were using a probe and show the kids how to use the probe?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (26:07):

There is a lab that I do with a BioRad that is largely a kit's, the PLO lab. That one is relatively complicated. So that one I have, there are video resources that I use for setting up, which are nice because it's a lot of steps and I don't think there's videos for them to show students from them. But there are videos that people have made that show how to swab plates that I might show the students demonstrating. I try to do it in person and also on a video just so they can see it in different ways. I suppose that particular lab has a lot of moving parts to it, and it's like the purpose of that lab is almost like an assessment of can you follow steps and follow directions kind of thing with the students.

Kimberly Herder (27:00):

It's obvious assessment

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (27:00):

Of that. So I suppose for that one there are some video esque resources. Yes.

Kimberly Herder (27:13):

Okay. Lemme go through the notes here a second. Oops. I'm on my laptop at home and that's never the most efficient. Same. Okay. When you think of Carolina Ward BioRad a plan, have you had any great experiences or have you had any horrid experiences?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (27:55):

Honestly, the best experiences I've had are out of Carolina because they send very clear instructions with what you order. But those are also usually kit esque, I suppose. And in that way it's very structured for me. So for a fruit fly lab, for example, as opposed to buying all the individual pieces, I guess I am reflecting now on how much kits are nice when I am able to get them, as opposed to me just being like, oh, I need to do a standard bacteria lab and I'm ordering agar from one place and Petri dishes from another place. And then I have all the little, I have all the beakers and stuff and oh, I need Kim wipes, and then it'll like, where am I ordering that from? So a lot of little things or then swabs, where's that coming from? And I don't really have the time to do price comparison stuff. So that for unfortunately falls upon, in my case, my department secretary where I'm just like, I think it's this one. And then she's like, no, you want to order it from here? And I go, of course

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (29:04):

She's also really useful for knowing that, oh, so-and-so also does that lab, do you want to wait a little bit and we can do a bulk order kind of thing. She's very, very good at that. So yeah, I guess with Carolina that's the best case. The worst things is just, I suppose the websites, the inventories are just so many. I'm not a real lab, I'm a lab light. So when need Petri dishes, I don't know why there's 200 kinds of Petri dishes and it's infuriating. Like I'm just an educator. I need the basic stuff. I don't need the crazy, crazy sterile one. I don't need the glass. I just need the ones that are good for 14 year olds. I'm going to get the cheap ones. I'm going to get the cheap ones. It's not that hard. Just give me an option, please, to sort by education purposes or something. That would be nice. I don't need the bougie stuff. They're 14 year olds. I don't need to buy them the $50 swabs. I could go get Q-tips realistically if I wanted to and just nuke in the microwave for something. I don't know. Yeah,

Kimberly Herder (30:24):

You're the MacGyver.

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (30:26):

I end up being that, yes, and I likely make a lot of mistakes with it. I'm not sure I'm the most efficient, but I don't have the time to be the most efficient either. I could, and I'm sure that if I worked at a different school where there really was a budget and that was a much more strict budget, I would have to be more money conscious. But I would be just infuriated by that. And I probably do fewer labs to be honest and just be frustrated by it, I suppose.

Kimberly Herder (30:54):

So when do you plan out your year? Or do you

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (30:59):

I plan out my year usually at the end of the pre, well, okay. I actually think about the next year as I'm doing the previous year, if that makes sense.

Kimberly Herder (31:09):

So

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (31:09):

I've had enough instances where I do a lesson and then I just assume that next year I'll remember what went right and when went wrong. So I'm usually pretty good at this point about making notes after the lesson is done, or at least within the week to make notes to myself for next year about what, oh, I use this microwave this time and these are the settings I'm trying to save myself. I always think about it as when I would put away the holiday lights with my family and there's a nice way to put them back in the box, that is a nice thing for future me. And then there's the way of just tossing it in there and then pissing my future self off and being frustrated with my past self. So I try really, really hard to make it so that when I get to May, and I'm thinking about next year loosely, that my stress levels are as low as possible because I know I have those notes available and general plan. But I would say that even in as a person who's almost been teaching for a decade, I usually only plan one unit at a time. I have a general idea of what units I'm going to cover, obviously in the grand scheme of things, but in terms of I just know when my end date is and what the summative is going to be and then getting the questions and spreading things out from there.

Kimberly Herder (32:38):

Are you doing any dissections or those kinds of things where you need to order things you can't get, probably can't get at Home Depot?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (32:49):

Yeah, we do. In my classroom, we dissect rats and I also usually order at least like pale of fetal pigs just so that there's that option for students. They're usually, if I ordered pigs, they'd the kids would've to be in groups of four. And I tend to find that working above in groups of three, there's always one kid that's not doing anything. But if I order rats, I can have them all the kids working in twos.

Kimberly Herder (33:19):

And that is because of price.

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (33:23):

Largely because of price. I would not want to spend, again, I don't know what my big picture budget is, but when I look at the price of the pigs, I go, oh yeah, I can't order I 80 of those. That would just not, I am cognizant enough of the fact that I know I should respect that, but rats, they're like $8 a piece now, I think. So yeah, I order those pretty much once I get back from winter break as I put in the order for rats. And then those show up hopefully before May when the dissections at the end of the year when the kids are like, I know them, I know who's going to be difficult. And they're all antsy and it's like, cool, let's just look at rats. Let's do that.

Kimberly Herder (34:07):

Okay. So do you remember where you, they've come from

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (34:13):

Carolina.

Kimberly Herder (34:15):

Okay. And you like their rats? Because

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (34:21):

When I think of biological specimens, I think Carolina, I feel like that's their niche. I know that there's also NASCO. I get their catalog every so often. I just have had good experience with Carolina. So I guess I just have brand loyalty for no reason, for no reason. I don't know.

Kimberly Herder (34:45):

They haven't done you wrong. They haven't

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (34:47):

Done me wrong. Right. Yeah.

Kimberly Herder (34:50):

So on those catalogs, you said that the assistant keeps track of 'em. Do you ever get access to them and what do You do? I think I wanted

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (34:59):

To, yeah, they're in our science office and I know they're there, but they're physical and they're big. And I don't want to, for lack of better words, if I was going to review a catalog, I would do it online. Because online has search functions, find functions, calculators. They're just easier for me. My tech savviness, I suppose when I get a physical catalog, even in my mailbox, I go, cool. And then I just bring it up to the department secretary going like, is this useful to you? That does restrict me in learning what's out there and what's new. I will admit that, but I just am not super physical male savvy or

Kimberly Herder (35:56):

Interested,

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (35:56):

I suppose.

Kimberly Herder (35:59):

So if you're on, do you ever just go on a site and look on et acat? I mean, look what they have to offer. As you're mentioning it, I should peruse this new stuff that's out there more often, but I

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (36:12):

Don't, and I also, you're just making me think about it. I also don't get advertisements or anything for them. I guess they're not targeted at me slash where would that even be? I don't think that my Facebook does technically know that I'm a science teacher, but I guess it doesn't show up on Facebook. But I feel like if it did, it would show up on Facebook. That's where most of my targeted ad seemed to show up. No, I genuinely, I guess if I was exposed to new stuff, it would be at a convention, like going to a biology NABT. I've only been to two of those just when they happen to be nearby or I happen to go to isef, the International Science and Engineering fair every year and every so often they have some cool research stuff, but not necessarily teacher focused, more research researcher, teacher focus as opposed to science teacher.

Kimberly Herder (37:15):

Have any of those, do they give coupons or would any of that be motivating for you to look at something?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (37:22):

Yeah, the last time I went to NABT, there were a number of places that were really interesting. We went around, the people in my department, we kind of split up and went around little groups and we're like, check that out, go over there and see what that's about. And they give you little promos, especially since ultimately the person who ends up putting the stamp of approval on a purchase is my department chair. And then she's the one who puts the ultimate stamp of approval. This is sciencey claim evidence reasoning is what we teach our kids. So claim, evidence, reasoning. I myself have to come up with claim evidence reasoning. If I wanted to make a big purchase, which I haven't had to do really much for my biology class, but my zoology class, I am making some larger purchases for and for that I need to create a claim evidence reasoning. I need to say, I want this. Well, why do you want this? And so if the company's able to give me that argument already, that's very helpful.

Kimberly Herder (38:27):

Well sir, if you're in that process right now and you could talk to a big company, what would they give you to make your life really easy? Say, I'm going to teach zoology. Wouldn't

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (38:41):

It be nice

Kimberly Herder (38:42):

Best stuff?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (38:42):

Wouldn't it be nice if there was something that, it's amazing how siloed education feels, even though every single school has a biology program, you would think that it could be standardized in some way, and yet it's not. But there have to be some commonalities and it's like a starter kit, right? I'm starting a zoology class and it is alarmingly difficult to just be like, well, what do I need? Or what do I think I need? What am I going to run into that I need? Is it just the same as a biology classroom? Is it not? What is it? Resource that, as far as I know doesn't exist would be very cool, is somehow being able to plug in, these are all the things I want to do. And somehow there was some AI or something that was able to be like, well, here's all the things you need.

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (39:48):

That'd be cool. Because I'm just learning that AI is just freaking amazing as of lately. But as far as I know, that's not necessarily a resource. It still comes down to, well, you're the expert, so what do you need? Go figure it out, kind of thing. And then I just assume at this point that most of my stuff is going to come from Carolina, because Carolina has a lot of the zoology things, that's kind of, again, their niche. They have the specimens, they have live specimens, they have models. That just seems to be their thing.

Kimberly Herder (40:24):

And you haven't really started poking around there yet.

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (40:28):

I have been making informal lists. It's just like the way that our school is set up. We are currently doing course recommendations right now. So that's the main focus is just to see how many sections there's going to be and how it works. And then the budgety stuff that my boss, her brain hasn't switched next year yet. She's just starting finishing off this year and doing the course recommendations to end. She considers that part of this year, that process is part of this year. And then when we get back from break, that's when we'll really hit the ground running with textbook supplies, giving a tentative budget, how much different specimens might cost, and also any room updates if are necessary to make it so that it's a zoology classroom

Kimberly Herder (41:20):

And safe and everything. So how do you guys keep that list? Is this a Google doc? Is it a Excel spreadsheet?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (41:30):

I'm currently making it as an Excel spreadsheet because that is more budgety, I guess, and it's not pretty, but it exists somewhere

Kimberly Herder (41:44):

On there. Oh, sorry.

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (41:46):

Yeah, just throwing things in and then just hyperlinks and stuff. So

Kimberly Herder (41:51):

On there you could say, zoology kit 1 0 7, whatever, and I could get it that these two different places, but this one's cheaper. Or do you even have to get that detailed, or how do you do that?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (42:06):

I feel like for my own personal level, I end up doing that and also making a note of what it is and what I would want it for. So I usually I would've it organized by aligned with my curriculum, so I have a general idea of what my curriculum's going to be. So it's like, well, this particular kit would go in with the invertebrates or it would go in with animal behavior. It goes in with this kind of thing. As my cats are messing with their food, I'm

Kimberly Herder (42:32):

Probably telling you they're hungry. They have automatic feeders so they can figure it out. Oh, okay. They're engineers as well? Yes. Oh, and that just made me lose it. I'm such a squirrel person. Or that was shiny. Oh, I think I just lost that one. So when you expect these kits or whatever you're doing in however this goes, that's not, what would you expect in is, is when you order your things, what do you get? Does it come with a video or CD or access to show you how to do them? What would you In

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (43:22):

A perfect world, I suppose. So let's say I was ordering a kit for a hydro lab, so I haven't ordered that yet. So it's a kit where we're getting live specimens of hydras and there's individual units. Ideally it would be something that I open up and everything. It's kind of like Ikea, e, where it's like here all the parts, they're labeled for every single group they need an A, B, A C, A D. That's what I'm doing. So as a science teacher, it's like I have these, and I think most teachers do this, but I have trays, they're little low trays and I fill it up with all the supplies kind of thing. And then those get distributed to all of my lab stations. But there is a core teacher station where I'm just like, okay, everyone gets a graduated cylinder, everyone gets a beaker, everyone gets this, and then it's right, it goes back out. So yeah, something that's a little bit more clear on that, I suppose.

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (44:29):

I definitely have ordered kits before in the past where it's kind of just like, well, here's a giant bag of blank. I'm like, cool. How much per group? I have multiple classes. So what am I doing? How much am I giving them? Am I going to have enough flavor? Am Are you making me do math right now? Thank you so much. And ideally, as you're ordering it and being like, I'm going to have this overall, it'd be super great if the inventory was almost instead of units, it's like, this is how many lab groups I'm doing. That'd be kind of cool. Again, I think it'd be like most science classrooms. It's like either students are in pairs or in groups of three. And then I just know that in this class I have seven groups.

Kimberly Herder (45:17):

When it comes to those groups and differentiating or scaffolding learning, how much of that do you do? And is that a big deal or would that be helpful

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (45:30):

If there was a resource to do it? I suppose realistically in live, my cat, sorry. What she's learned is she's learned that if she messes with it, maybe some food will drop out. So what was I saying?

Kimberly Herder (45:53):

Differentiating?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (45:55):

Differentiating, yes. In the real world, differentiation is done live. I am going over and giving that group what it is that they need in that moment or that student, what they need. I usually don't have as much physical differentiation or at least nothing that's super obvious. If I do differentiate and it's physical, maybe for example, it's like I'm giving students a glossary. Everyone gets the glossary. No one's being singled out for being like, here's this glossary for you. And then some kids choose to use it or not. Particularly in my school, we don't have tracking. So in my classroom, I have students at the fourth grade reading level and the 12th grade reading level. So that kind of results in a lot of needed self differentiation or I in the moment need to switch on a different hat when I'm talking with them and discussing things with them. So if it was something that was just built into a kit, my God, that'd be cool, especially if it's something that's subtle, something that another group wouldn't look over and be like, why is yours written differently? Or Why is yours already premeasured or something. I don't know exactly what that would be. But in terms of most skills that need to be differentiated is reading. That's really the big one. Yeah. Comprehension.

Kimberly Herder (47:17):

Okay there. All right. So we talked a little bit about what your big wish would be, but just to reiterate or if there's something other that, okay, we're going to take this information and we're going to present it to the heads of these companies. What do you want us to pass on? I

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (47:41):

Guess it would just be in terms of a big wish. It would be cool if there was a website that just had a giant list of interesting labs. Just labs. Just labs, just a collection of labs. And they don't have to be super fancy, my God, they don't have to be super fancy. They really don't. But there are things that I can look at and be like, oh my God, I want to do that. I want my students to do that. And it's accessible because being a teacher too, part of it is me being human is like, do I have the time to also learn what that is and how that works? I would want it to be something where it's like, cool, I'm going to order one of those for me to try out for myself because I'm going to do it at least once for myself to try it out. Ideally, it's the exact same thing that the kids would have. And then what's like if I end up liking it, I'm able to order it in units of lab groups. That would be amazing. And then ultimately, as you were saying, if it came with worksheets and stuff, again, in my reality, I would probably take that worksheet and I'd make my own from it. I would be spinning it into whatever my particular storyline is, and there's just really no way to, as far as I know, there's no way to customize it that easily.

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (49:07):

But yeah. And then I would also say in the best case scenario, there would also be some sort of a video that literally just does the lab, not as a cheat code for the students, but as a teacher, when students are absent, it's a freaking nightmare, especially keeping lab stuff around. And especially if they're in kits where I'm like, well, you just weren't here, but I'm out of stuff. So being able to give them that experience in some way, being it visual or what have you, and a video where they're like, oh, and here's the data you would get, or here's an example of data that would happen so that they can still do the worksheet and stuff. It's someone who's pretending that they're doing it, I suppose, or not pretending they're actually doing it. Student view.

Kimberly Herder (50:00):

When you said that, would it be helpful to have a video just for your classmate room at large safety or something that needs to happen in this lab or,

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (50:13):

Sure. I'd use that, especially if it's, again, it's a kit that I myself did not put together. There might be something that I myself don't necessarily know, so it would be helpful if that was in there and it would be in text, but I'm pretty confident saying I read things, but you never really know, which you kind of miss and being able to make sure that's getting communicated to the students.

Kimberly Herder (50:46):

And one more question, and I'm kind of jumping back to when you say you're ordering kits and I'm thinking, okay, you've got a live something coming or whatever.

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (50:55):

In

Kimberly Herder (50:55):

Other interviews that we've done, reliability has come up often. Where is that in your decision making process of knowing whether you're buying something at Home Depot or you've ordered it from Flynn?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (51:20):

I mean, obviously I would appreciate quality. That makes sense. But I also actually, maybe I'm in the minority, but I actually prefer when there's a diversity of results because that's way more realistic of what real science is. I personally enjoyed the discussion of students being like, well, I didn't see that. And then a lot of the labs that we do, or at least that I did in high school, were fake labs. We were told that this is what's happening, but actually the teacher might've added baking. He had added secret little things to make the results happen the way that we wanted to. Why must you do this now? Why do you have the zoomies now?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (52:06):

So in real science, the lab doesn't always work, and I actually appreciate when some group's, labs don't work because it's worth discussing the realities of life of, oh, it didn't work. Why don't we think it worked? And that's not error analysis. I mean, it's partly error analysis, but it's also like, well, where did we mess up? What did they do differently? What didn't you take seriously? There's life lessons to be learned there. It's actually ridiculous that when students are like, what do you mean a PhD takes eight years? It's like, well, it's not like you're just showing up and doing lab time. You're like, this was made for you. This was someone's PhD thesis in the thirties. This has been tested for you. So I actually appreciate variation in results. I appreciate variability and even a little bit of flexibility if possible. Heaven forbid, and this is slightly different thing, but it'd be cool if even if the kits that gave students choice in whatever that lab might be, giving them a little bit of flexibility and like, do you want to go this? You could do this, you could do this. You could see what happens here. It depends on the specific lab, but realistically, at the end of the day, my students are not going to remember the scientific facts. They're going to remember the experience and the skills that they're getting out of it. And in some cases, again, it's not, this is how you measure with a beaker. Oh, it's important that I'm paying attention when I'm measuring out anything basic lessons. But those are the lessons that need to be learned

Kimberly Herder (53:42):

And that they'll remember that part too. Yes. Okay. Well, thank you. We went over time and I apologize for that. I was late. Well, I appreciate the insights that you've given and your enthusiasm, and who knows, maybe next time I'm in Evanston, I'll see if the security at the front door will let me in.

Kimberly Herder (54:11):

So next steps are that it'll really be there tonight or tomorrow morning. I'll send you an email that will have a thank you because yes, it's a huge thank you, but it's going to have two more questions in it. Just one, if you think of something tonight, tomorrow, the next week, the next month, whenever either that we talked about and you want to add a little bit more on to or something else that you just, we work with a lot of large life sciences companies and would have the channel to be able to pass on information. So

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (54:54):

That would be cool. And then the second question is if you would like to participate in something like this again, again, this

Kimberly Herder (55:00):

Is what we do.

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (55:03):

I enjoy these. I feel like it's useful because, and in some way I will admit it feels a little bit arrogant, but it's like I feel like I'm a good teacher and it's just like what influence I can have to try to help other people be good teachers. And part of that is through resources and being able to communicate. That's part of the reason why I'm so involved with the social media is being able to communicate to someone being like, that's a great idea. Have you also considered just talking to the kids? Just little pedagogy tips that are Yes.

Kimberly Herder (55:43):

Yes. So that's good. And then Daylene or your gift card will come from Daylene and you'll have an option. It can be, you can do a Visa gift card or Target. I mean, there's several different things on there that, different cards that you can use for the holiday or whatever you want to. Cool. We'll do that and let me see if I'm thinking. Do you have any questions?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (56:11):

Not right now.

Kimberly Herder (56:12):

Okay. Alright. Well then I'll give you your evening back and your cats and your zoology in the making.

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (56:21):

Yes,

Kimberly Herder (56:22):

Yes. I'm very

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (56:23):

Excited.

Kimberly Herder (56:24):

Okay. All right. Thank you so much. Thank

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (56:27):

You.

Kimberly Herder (56:27):

Okay, take good care.

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (56:28):

Bye

Kimberly Herder (56:29):

Bye.

Daylene Long (56:42):

I got to jump to my next call, but it sounded like it went well.

Kimberly Herder (56:46):

Alright. Yeah. Did you hear a little bit? We went long. I was trying to get things back in and Yeah, a little bit. I had dinner with my husband though and just kind of

Daylene Long (56:56):

Rested for a little bit and I got to hop off to my next call, but I'll get the gift certificates out tonight and we'll talk tomorrow.

Kimberly Herder (57:02):

Okay.

Daylene Long (57:03):

Okay. Take Care. Thank you so Much for doing that, by the way.

Kimberly Herder (57:06):

Oh, absolutely. Okay,

Daylene Long (57:08):

Bye.

Daylene Long (00:02):

Okay. Tell us about our next educator. Ms. Kimberly?

Kimberly Herder (00:08):

Yes. This is Janet Alga. I don't know. M-A-G-A-R-G-A-L. Mag rga

Daylene Long (00:18):

Al. We'll ask her how to pronounce it.

Kimberly Herder (00:22):

Yes. She's been teaching for 27 years as a science and teacher and she's gone. Looks like she's been directors and stuff, but kind stepped back, but right now, well, I don't know. She's an instructional supervisor, so I think that's like a TOSA for us it sounds like. Okay.

Daylene Long (00:41):

District level,

Kimberly Herder (00:43):

She's at the high school and it's a large high school, so I don't know. I don't know if that means just if it's more than a department chair or what that means. She's in, remind me of something else. She's the ELL biology teacher and she's also the genetics teacher. So in the profile of the school, it doesn't say how many, but it says a very diverse background of students. So she teaches biology to ELL students, which is pretty darn cool. The school or the school district is struggling. There's a teacher shortage and it's not that they're leaving teachers, they're leaving the school district. There's just some

Daylene Long (01:31):

Okay. Us and let you know that she's coming into the conversation a little bit early now. Okay. Anything else before I let her in?

Kimberly Herder (01:40):

They do have ACTE program at the school. It does not say, and she's STEM certified, whatever that means, but it doesn't say that the CTE program, what that involves.

Daylene Long (01:54):

Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and let her in.

Janet Magargal (02:12):

Good evening.

Daylene Long (02:13):

Good evening, Janet. How are you?

Janet Magargal (02:16):

I am good. How are

Daylene Long (02:17):

You? I am very good. Kim, you want to kind of kick us off for our call?

Kimberly Herder (02:23):

Yes, I do. First, Janice. Janet, I would like to know how do you say your last name and then two, do you have, we can't see you. Do you have access to a camera?

Janet Magargal (02:34):

I do, but I did not do my hair and makeup and I'm putting sweatshirt on. I didn't realize this was going to be recorded, so I'm a little embarrassed the way I look.

Daylene Long (02:44):

Well, if we promise, promise you, no one will see the video, that we just want to be able to interact with you. We do record it, but it's really just for the transcript for our notes, so I promise no one will see you but us.

Janet Magargal (03:00):

Good morning. I'm in sweatpants.

Kimberly Herder (03:02):

Hey,

Daylene Long (03:04):

It's all good. I'm in sweatpants too, actually, and I didn't wear any makeup for any of you, so

Kimberly Herder (03:12):

Yeah, I'm working from home today too, and holding a hot cup of tea because this room is freezing, so yes.

Janet Magargal (03:20):

Okay, turn the camera on. I don't understand. That's funny. I did turn it on now on. Yeah,

Kimberly Herder (03:33):

Well, if my husband yesterday went through a Zoom, oh, there you go. Zoom meeting that he had. The little,

Janet Magargal (03:39):

I don't see me though. Do you

Kimberly Herder (03:40):

See me? The little thing at the top? Is it pushed over the,

Janet Magargal (03:45):

Oh, there it's, there we go.

Kimberly Herder (03:47):

My husband led a Zoom meeting all yesterday and then I guess really got on the IT person afterwards because he wasn't on screen and he was supposed to lead this, and then finally they figured it out. It was the little thing at the top.

Janet Magargal (04:01):

Oh, geez. Yes. No, I had both off on the bottom left as well. Yep.

Kimberly Herder (04:08):

How do you say your last name?

Janet Magargal (04:11):

Mle. Maar.

Daylene Long (04:12):

Mle. Okay. So it's three syllables.

Janet Magargal (04:17):

Yep, mug gargle. Okay.

Kimberly Herder (04:21):

That's a really cool last name.

Janet Magargal (04:24):

Thank you.

Daylene Long (04:27):

So like I said, we are recording, but we're only going to use it for notes, and I promise not to put you on YouTube or share clips of you or anything like that. It's just really for our note taking purposes because doing quite a few of these interviews and if we just relied on my memory, we'd be in trouble.

Janet Magargal (04:50):

Oh, I understand. Yes, I take notes on everything.

Daylene Long (04:55):

Yeah.

Kimberly Herder (04:56):

Thank you for agreeing to do this and yeah, what you say is taken very seriously and information will move forward onto the client and will impact life science education. So I'm going to step off the close my camera, but I'll pop back on if we have technical difficulties or if there's a question I need to follow up. But I would like to start, can you take a minute, just give us a little of your background and what you're doing right now?

Janet Magargal (05:33):

Yes. I'm currently teaching in small Catholic school. I am on my 29th year. No. Oh my gosh. This is my 31st year of teaching.

Daylene Long (05:53):

Yeah,

Janet Magargal (05:54):

I feel very old right now that I had to think about that, but I was in public school for 27 years. I started my teaching career in a Catholic school for three years, so just helping me with my math if this is so, yeah, really it's like 30 and a half years. That's crazy. Time flies when you're having fun.

Daylene Long (06:16):

It does, and you look up and you realize that you have been working for 30 years, so that's always interesting. Is there any, you mentioned it's a small Catholic school. About how many students do you guys have

Janet Magargal (06:29):

Total? About 200. And it's K through 12.

Daylene Long (06:32):

Okay. It is in your high school segment. About how many people do you have or students?

Janet Magargal (06:42):

About 90.

Daylene Long (06:43):

Okay. So it's small, but it's also a good size. It's not a super tiny one or that kind of thing, so that must be nice. From a teaching perspective, what are your teacher to student ratios then?

Janet Magargal (06:59):

Oh, it's wonderful. The upper level. I have eight students, so it's great. And then I biology, the classes would be 16. It's funny. They're balanced.

Daylene Long (07:17):

Yeah. How many people do you usually have in a lab group then?

Janet Magargal (07:22):

Well, it depends on what lab we're doing. I sometimes like the groups of four, which works out perfectly with 16, so four groups of four, but it really depends on what class and what lab. A lot of times with the advanced class, the AP students, I'll just have the students work in pairs, so it's nice. Everyone definitely gets to have experiences with the lab equipment and understanding the concepts processes.

Daylene Long (07:53):

That's great. Well, I'm just going to walk through a couple of the basics. I was just thinking about how your school might be different from some of the other ones that we talked to, so that's a really good, helpful background. Oh, one more question. So we just talked to somebody actually that was at a Catholic school that was a Salian Catholic school. Does yours have a particular, is it Jesuit? Is it just Catholic or does it have a particular angle to it?

Janet Magargal (08:23):

Mean everyone is welcome. It's full inclusion. I mean in terms of lay people are, I mean it's all instruction by lay people we are associated and affiliated with. I'm really new. I've only been here four months and I'm really embarrassed that it's not, remember the order of nuns, they're associated.

Daylene Long (08:51):

That's okay. And two, you've only been there for four months. There may be times that we want to pop back to your last year of experience too, to kind of talk, because our focus today is really on how you go about deciding what you're going to use, what you're going to buy for a science classroom, which materials you're going to use and that type of thing. So you can kind of help us know when we should draw on your experience at your current school and when we need to draw on experience from the last position you were in.

Janet Magargal (09:29):

Okay. Is that the whole goal of your interview? Your whole purpose is to, what do you need to learn from me? What is your objective tonight?

Daylene Long (09:37):

So our objective is really to understand how we can better serve science teachers in terms of the materials that are provided, the support materials that are around it, what you like, what you don't like, what you wish you had. Our ultimate objective really is for our client, giving them ideas on how to make everything that they provide better for teachers and for students. So it helps to understand what's important to you now, how you feel about it, and then to understand what's missing or what you wish you had. You are going to see us ask a lot of what and why questions, and that kind of gets at those types of things. We really like hearing how you feel about it too. A lot of people don't necessarily share that, but we want to know are there points of frustration? Are there points where you really appreciate something? So we're looking for that. It helps if you think of Kim and I as shooting like a documentary about your experience of the supplies and what you get and what you like and all of those other kinds of things, because you're going to see us kind of get down into some details of do you use a catalog, do you use the website, what do you wish you had, and those kinds of things.

Janet Magargal (11:14):

Okay.

Daylene Long (11:17):

So if that fits okay with you, I will dive right in.

Janet Magargal (11:21):

Sounds good.

Daylene Long (11:22):

Okay. So we talked a little bit, and you'll have to let me know if this is for your current school or for the last one, about the last time that you purchased supplies for Life science classroom. Was that at the Catholic school you're at or was that

Janet Magargal (11:40):

Absolutely.

Daylene Long (11:41):

Okay. So tell me a little bit about that. You're a brand new teacher and you come in and what do you do in terms of, I'm sorry. Sorry. In terms of making sure you have everything you need.

Janet Magargal (11:57):

Well, I'm in the middle of this process as we speak. Since I am new to the environment, new to what does this lab have, how do I use the equipment in this lab? What does the curriculum require? There are two totally different curriculums that I am purchasing materials for. So it's right now, I mean your timing is, this is perfect. This is amazing because I am in the middle of yes, learning what I need to order. Actually, yes, I document everything and trying to

Speaker 4 (12:33):

In a spreadsheet, because

Daylene Long (12:42):

Your audio's cutting out a little bit.

Speaker 4 (12:48):

Audio,

Daylene Long (12:49):

Your audio's cutting out a little bit

Speaker 4 (13:02):

Internet

Janet Magargal (13:05):

Just to see if that helps with

Speaker 4 (13:07):

Connection.

Daylene Long (13:07):

Okay. That got a little bit better.

Speaker 4 (13:09):

Can you hear

Janet Magargal (13:22):

Me?

Daylene Long (13:22):

Yes. Okay. Okay.

Janet Magargal (13:25):

I just closed out a bunch of windows.

Daylene Long (13:27):

Okay. I think that's helping. That's helping. So just kind of maybe rewind just a little bit for us. You said it was really good timing that you were right in the middle of doing this. You mentioned two different curriculums. What are the two different curriculums that you're buying for?

Janet Magargal (13:46):

Yes, I teach an AP biology class and that is strictly guided by the college board.

Daylene Long (13:56):

So

Janet Magargal (13:56):

All of those materials that I need to buy are pretty much outlined in all of the different labs that we have that are required. So it's a pretty prescribed curriculum by the college board. It is challenging because you have so many choices and you have a limited amount of time. But I mean, I have free reign of trusting my professional opinion as to what I need to order and what company. So, so far this year I have chosen BioRad. I have chosen LG beads, I've used Amazon. I'm trying to think what else. I don't want to open all my spreadsheets now because I'm afraid to lose up my internet here.

Daylene Long (14:43):

I know. I think you listed, I had your track.

Janet Magargal (14:51):

Let's see here. Oh, pivot Interactives. We ordered as, and then of course I have to go to just the local Whole Foods Gentilly Acme Produce Junction for consumables I've used.

Daylene Long (15:14):

Okay. I think Kimberly, do you by chance have that information, I think that you also listed, if I remember correctly, are there any vendors that you use for any other supplies, like any of the other type of consumables, whether or not they are chemical supplies or organisms or those types of things?

Janet Magargal (15:49):

Carolina, I see science takeout. Just looking through the curriculum that I will be using, I could see there's a lot of molecular 3D models. I really enjoy. I like those. It's called Molecular 3D design. I was just introduced to those last month. A lot of the manipulatives, you need hands-on activities, so they're really amazing. A lot of the stuff they have.

Daylene Long (16:22):

You said you were introduced to them last month. Where were you introduced to the map?

Janet Magargal (16:26):

They were in the room from the previous teacher, so bought a lot of things. I mean, everything was left in the room. So that's where I mentioned it's great timing because I'm still learning. There's a ton of equipment that has been purchased and still remains in the room from the previous teacher. So it's amazing. It's just like every time I go through and I'm looking through another cabinet, I'm like, oh, this is really neat. I made a 3D DNA model. I would have to look at the kit if you need the exact name of who that was, but that was really neat, just the level of detail.

Daylene Long (17:05):

So you've been kind of doing an inventory of what they have then, and then how are you deciding what it is that you need to get?

Janet Magargal (17:17):

Well, I fall back on what is outlined in the AP curriculum for that course.

Daylene Long (17:25):

Okay. And you mentioned ap, I'm sorry, what was the other curriculum you're using?

Janet Magargal (17:31):

The other curriculum is, it's a biology curriculum and we follow the next Generation Science standards. So it's very inquiry based and that's where the creativity comes in as to my experiences and what's best to follow that curriculum.

Daylene Long (17:49):

Okay. Do you by chance, remember the name of the curriculum? Is it

Janet Magargal (17:53):

It's Iub Biology.

Daylene Long (17:56):

I'm sorry, say it again.

Janet Magargal (17:57):

It's a National Science Foundation. IUB Biology.

Daylene Long (18:02):

Iub Biology, okay. And it sounded like it was an NS SF Project,

Janet Magargal (18:10):

National Science NSF funded Curriculum.

Daylene Long (18:16):

Cutting out just a little bit, but so if I ask you to repeat it or if I try to, I will also try to repeat what I understood from you just in case it's cutting out a little bit.

Janet Magargal (18:28):

Okay. I'm sorry.

Daylene Long (18:29):

Okay. So let me ask this. I'm kind of curious. You go into this classroom and there's all these cool things with the ALBs and the Bio-Rad and the Carolina and Science Takeout. If you haven't used those materials before or had you used them before, how do you kind of figure out how you're going to incorporate those into your hands-on experiences?

Janet Magargal (19:02):

Well, both. Some things I have used before, and it's a good memories like, oh, 20 years ago I remember using this. So again, I just try it first. I just research go online. So the Algae Beads was a totally new experience. I've never worked with Algae Beads. What introduced me to that, they actually weren't in the classroom. It was from my training in the summer for AP Bio. They sent me to a summer training and as a part of the training, they had a guest speaker that was from that company that sent free samples to our home, and we got to work with 'em and see what they did in the summer and then sent us a lesson plan of what you could do. So as I got to the topic now, it's about cellular respiration and photosynthesis. So the little algae beads are in sodium alginate and they're in an indicator solution that detects the presence of acids and bases.

Janet Magargal (20:08):

So it's really a neat way of showing the kids the connection between photosynthesis and respiration. So that would be what made me choose that lab, particularly because okay, students need to understand the connection between you exhale carbon dioxide and the plants need the carbon dioxide. So it was just spot on in terms of it gave the kids a visual. It was simple. I appreciated the fact that you mentioned what do teachers need? Things are busy, everybody's busy. So I was very appreciative of the fact that the experts of who designed and made the AL gbs, that company came up with all the background information and they had a handout for us as teachers to show us, because I didn't make connections to the Carbonate cycle. So they provided us with resources, with background, and then they actually had a lesson plan, so it was kind of ready to go. And then the answer key was very appreciative too. I mean, just because you're busy, it's not a matter of, you can't figure it out. It's a matter of you just simply don't have time. You know what I mean? It's just a different world. I mean, there's the internet, everybody, you're constantly getting emails 24 7. So it's very appreciated when that type of option is available for me personally.

Daylene Long (21:43):

So you mentioned it was at an AP training, and so I'm wondering, sorry, I'm getting a little bit of feedback. Was it an AP conference or was it an APSI meeting one of the ap? Yes,

Janet Magargal (22:05):

It was the APSI. It was virtual.

Daylene Long (22:08):

Oh, it was a virtual apsi?

Janet Magargal (22:10):

It was a virtual AP PSI. So that's why they sent the lab equipment to our house so we could do the labs virtually. So I go forward to buying. There was another one, it was a mini PCRI forget the exact name of the company. I brought everything into work and I left it there. But again, just having that experience, that's something new that I would love to try.

Daylene Long (22:35):

Okay. So you mentioned Algae Beads and me, PCR at that training, were there any other companies that sent things home for you to learn how to use?

Janet Magargal (22:54):

I think they were the only two that sent stuff to the house.

Daylene Long (23:00):

Okay. Did any of them send catalogs or anything like that, or were those really the only two that were represented?

Janet Magargal (23:09):

Represented? They sent the kits and then the contact information, you can look to see what else now online if you like their resources. I'm on their email. I always sign up for everything. So I am on their email list and now I can see what else they have, what other options I might want to buy.

Daylene Long (23:29):

Okay, that sounds good. Let's see. You also mentioned Pivot Interactive. Was that something that your school was using before you came?

Janet Magargal (23:42):

Yes. One of my colleagues, actually Science department chair, introduced me to that and she thought that would be a great option, the simulations and just the questions and how that's staffed. So she ordered that for use with the students.

Daylene Long (24:02):

Okay. And you're using that with your AP Bio class?

Janet Magargal (24:09):

Yes, I have. I like to use it with all classes, just I have to figure out how yet where it will fit in best.

Daylene Long (24:17):

Okay. Do you use the pivot together with hands-on labs, or do you use them sometimes as instead of hands-on labs? How does that work?

Janet Magargal (24:31):

That work so far I've used them as an additional reinforcement. We use, I mean, we use our class time is pretty much to focus on lab experiences or hands-on or maybe processing a little of what their homework was. It's minimal lecture. I mean, sometimes you do have to lecture. The Pivot interactives. So far this year, I mean only a couple months in, I have assigned them as just supplemental reinforcement of what we saw in class. So homework.

Daylene Long (25:07):

Okay. Are you buying just for your classrooms or are you helping other educators decide what they need for theirs, or is your role mostly as a teacher or as a department chair?

Janet Magargal (25:20):

I'm not a department chair, but we all collaborate and I mean, yeah, we could influence each other. I mean, we could help each other like, Hey, I found this cool activity. Do you want to try it? So I definitely see, because we have meetings all the time about different things, so it's a very supportive environment and if somebody finds something, that's how I learned about Pivot. She was like, Hey, this is really cool. I'm using this in my physics class. Do you want to try it? I'm like, well, let me see. I'm like, oh, yeah. Oh, and that's how Vernier, she also showed me, I'm going to try. I don't know when, but I really like the software and we have probes. She was doing something with forces with it, and it was so neat. They're Bluetooth, so they talked to the computers. So I look forward to trying that as well. So we'll see when, but

Daylene Long (26:13):

Okay. And let's see. You mentioned Carolina. What did you get from Carolina?

Janet Magargal (26:24):

There were kits already. Oh, geez. Thought it was when we did the stains. I think it was mostly just stains. Oh,

Daylene Long (26:34):

What kind of stains?

Janet Magargal (26:36):

Iodine. We did a carbohydrate lab.

Daylene Long (26:40):

Carbohydrate lab, okay. And it was camp that you got?

Janet Magargal (26:46):

This was leftover. Yeah, I am so sorry. I'll have to look that up. If you need specifics

Daylene Long (26:55):

At some point, if you don't mind,

Janet Magargal (26:57):

A couple months ago.

Daylene Long (26:59):

That's okay. If you don't mind sending it to me afterwards, that would be helpful. I'm just trying to get a sense of what works for you and fits the kits or if there's other materials that you're using and that type of thing.

Janet Magargal (27:14):

Okay. It's definitely a combination that I've been using so far over the past couple months. I mean, things that I know will fit well in the curriculum.

Daylene Long (27:25):

Okay, that sounds good.

Janet Magargal (27:28):

I Google things constantly too.

Daylene Long (27:30):

So you're Googling things constantly, and it sounds like you're getting feedback too from the other teachers in your school that that's playing a part. Do you go into any of the life science communities that are online, like on Facebook or Twitter or any of those?

Janet Magargal (27:51):

Yes. National Facebook National Biology teacher's. Facebook page is like my DFFI visit that every day.

Daylene Long (28:00):

The NABT Facebook page?

Janet Magargal (28:03):

Absolutely, yes. It's an amazing resource. And that's where I get a lot of the ideas for the labs, because I know that they're tried or true. It's nice to know, you know what I mean? Oh, we did the yeast spheres. I've never done that before. So that would be an Amazon order. So that's not even a kit. I mean, that was just an idea. I got off of Facebook. You buy yeast, you buy sodium alginate, buy calcium chloride, and it was a really neat way of taking a look at enzyme activity.

Janet Magargal (28:43):

So you make literally yeast balls at yeast spheres and you put 'em in high. Oh, hydrogen peroxide. I did buy that at the store because I couldn't find it on Amazon. And you literally have the students make the little yeast spheres and you drop 'em in, you change all the variables. Some students had more yeast, some students had more concentrated hydrogen peroxide. I had a water bath going, a hot water bath. I had ice. I added soap to one. I had eight students, so I had each student test a different variable. So a lot of the things you can see you just buy at the store. So I kind of took different ideas that I saw on the AP bio, and I kind of tweaked my own, I mean my own lab version of it, just to make it a little more authentic. I don't know.

Daylene Long (29:33):

So some of the consumables, it sounds like you're buying either at just a grocery store or sometimes on Amazon. Amazon. Is that Yes. Okay. How do you decide which one you're going to go to, whether or not you're going to get it just from a local store or whether or not you're going to get it from Amazon?

Janet Magargal (29:49):

Who has the better price? Usually whoever has the best price is usually the winner.

Daylene Long (29:58):

Yeah. Does your school have an Amazon business account, or are you responsible for They do. Okay. They do. Okay. So with all of these different things that you've been looking for and buying, and it sounds like you're still buying some of them them, have you had any really stand out good experiences that you can share where you were just really happier than usual at your buying experience? I

Janet Magargal (30:40):

Mean, I feel like all of them have been pretty positive. I bought, oh, I did buy, who is it? E coli. I bought e coli and ampicillin. Was that BioRad? I mean, everything has come very quickly. I mean, the algae beads, there's excellent communication. Yes. That was BioRad. I bought ampicillin and e coli and I was very pleased with BioRad. They were punctual, they were on time. They communicated you could follow the tracking. That's very helpful because where our supplies come, they come to a different location and the person at the receptionist desk who has to take in that information, I mean the eco, I had to be refrigerated. The ampicillin had to be refrigerated, so it was nice to track it. So then I could give her a heads up. She knew when it was coming. She communicated right away with me saying, Hey, your supplies are here. So I do appreciate that. I mean, the Alga beads, same thing. They were very good with communication, so they were the big companies. And then even Amazon, everything that I've ordered with them so far, they had a problem, the shipping delay for something, and they just said, sorry, it'll be another delay, but as long as you talk to me, I can plan.

Daylene Long (32:12):

Yeah. The ECOT line, the ampicillin, were those kits or were you just buying the materials?

Janet Magargal (32:22):

I bought them just as separate materials because my whole philosophy is I don't like a lot of things to lay around in the lab. And there were plenty of Petri dishes. It's a Luigi broth or Oh, geez, I should really be able to talk more intelligently. Sorry. The learning curve with City of Broth, anyway, there was a broth already in the lab, so instead of buying new, I just bought replacement. So we had the Petri dishes, we had Q-tips, so I mixed up the broth and I made the Petri dishes already study for the students. And then

Daylene Long (33:00):

Did they provide instructions for making the broth or was that something you knew how to do from previous or,

Janet Magargal (33:10):

I knew, yeah, that was something I knew how to do. Okay.

Daylene Long (33:16):

So with any of these vendors too, do any of them put, when you get your box, do any of them give you swag or unexpected surprises or instructions that you particularly like or safety things or anything like that?

Janet Magargal (33:38):

No, I expect surprises. The algae kit had, they have directions. All of them, I could say came with directions, what to do, thanking you. I think there was a couple that said, thank you for your purchase. They give you contact information, so if you want to order again or an advertisement, here's our website so you can look at other options for your labs.

Daylene Long (34:09):

Okay.

Janet Magargal (34:09):

They're the only things that I can remember off the top of my head.

Daylene Long (34:11):

Do you ever use videos either for teaching, other than the pivot, do you ever use videos for either refreshing yourself on how to do a lab or for your students to prep for a lab?

Janet Magargal (34:28):

Yes to both. I've never did the e Spears Spheres lab, and I wasn't sure about how to make the sodium alginate solution. And I did watch a video, I think it was a YouTube video on just how to make it, because I read in the directions that it said prep this several days before, because it's a large polymer, it could take a while to dissolve. It's not something you do right before the lab for the kids and our schedule, we follow a seven day cycle schedule, and it rotates seven letter days and seven number days, so you don't ever see the students the same time back to back days. So it just requires, from the lab management aspect, I'm learning, it's a lot of planning because you might not see a student, you might see that class maybe only three times a week. Maybe you see the class five days a week, but it's never at the same time because it's a constant routine schedule.

Janet Magargal (35:28):

So it's good to, you know what I mean, watch the videos, make sure you really know how to prep the lab. And then it's also very, what I like also about the schedule is that okay, again, all about the planning, but if I know that I'm not going to see the students tomorrow, I could give them the video to help prep them. If I know it's a hard concept or a hard lab, watch this video. So you have an idea when I see you on Friday, what your actual lab is. So I haven't done that yet. I've done more of the pre-lab questions, like read this so that when we see each other next and we have a lab notebook, I have the AP bio students go old school, we keep a lab notebook. So it's good because they have a chance to really think about the lab and know what to expect before we do it.

Daylene Long (36:18):

Okay. And then how do you find those videos? Do you Google, are they provided by suppliers, other teachers? How do you find the videos that you use?

Janet Magargal (36:32):

Usually I Google my Go-to, I usually just Google take the initiative. What do I need? What do I know? I mean, you have a lot of tools in your toolbox after teaching for a long time. So it's a matter of, okay, wait, I remember doing something interactive websites. I mean, there's so many favorites that I always go to as a bio teacher, so you know what I mean. I might start with those websites sometimes if I know they created a lab or did something that I remember doing. If not, YouTube's usually a good start.

Daylene Long (37:06):

What are some of your favorite interactive channels or

Janet Magargal (37:10):

I love Learn Genetics is a favorite. Howard Hughes Medical Center is another

Daylene Long (37:17):

Favorite. HHMI. Yep,

Janet Magargal (37:19):

Yep. They're right up there. They're the big favorites. Okay.

Daylene Long (37:25):

All right. That's good to know. And it is always good when those are supplementing your teaching. Right. Let's see. We've got a little bit of time left and I want to make sure, I'm going to flip through all of my questions real fast. So when you think about a concept like a reliable vendor, a trustworthy vendor, a quality vendor, one that you would say that you're loyal to, what are the aspects that make up that feeling? Trust in a vendor

Janet Magargal (38:15):

Knowing that I could count on their supplies for being quality in terms of scientific concept. Okay. Scientific concepts. I mean, that would be the priority. Are they able to give me some kind of either lab? It depends. Is it a manipulative, is it an actual lab product? Something that is really going to be able to help the students understand the concept. I mean, the quality of the science is usually the priority. Okay. Trustworthy vendor. I mean, if they're going to give me coupons for coming back would be that would build my trust. How do you coupon appreciate me

Daylene Long (38:56):

You coupons. Okay. Yeah,

Janet Magargal (38:59):

That would work.

Daylene Long (39:00):

Did they give you any coupons at the A PSI or they just No, they didn't. Okay. Yeah, that's always interesting. I think that teachers always like a good deal, and I always appreciate the fact that you guys pay such close attention to getting good value for the students that you serve. Thank you. Yeah. So let me see what else I've got on here. If you could wave a magic wand for a minute and have either some sort of supply or resource or something that made your job easier or made it better for student learning, if I gave you a magic wand and you could wave it that something would be available, what would that be?

Janet Magargal (39:56):

Well, right now in a new position, I would like my lab completely organized so I know exactly what I have because I'm feeling a little bit like, oh, I don't know where everything is today. There was all of these little foam tongue depressors. They look like tongue depressors, but they're foam. And I was so excited to find that box because I'm like, I can introduce chromosomes with them and write with a magic marker, make alleles on them letters. So I was so excited to find them, but it literally took me an hour to organize them because it was all chaotic. So right now, my magic wand is probably not telling you information that you want, but I would love to have my lab organized so I could tell you, okay, yes, I would like this, this, and this. In terms of supply my problem, I don't know exactly what all my supplies are until I think I go through the whole year.

Janet Magargal (41:01):

I won't be able to tell you exactly what kind of supply I need. I'm very, very lab-based, so that would be maybe my magic wand wish that keep things affordable so I can keep buying the hands-on in the lab supplies for my students because they really appreciate. I do a survey with the kids. He always asks, how do you want to learn? What could I do as your teacher to make learning fun and better for you? And I would bet 99.9% of my kids on our back to school survey, they want hands-on want lectures, they want to do things, they want to experience science. And I totally agree with that. We're on the same page. Yeah,

Daylene Long (41:49):

That's great. That's a good fit it. Do any of the vendors, so you mentioned just having to reorganize and to your lab, did any of the materials already come organized either because they came in a container or they had directions or they had something? Did any of the suppliers come more organized than others

Janet Magargal (42:19):

Coming into somebody else's lab? They actually took them out of a lot of the original boxes and they put them in Tupperware containers. So yes, some vendors have very detailed directions because I found them in the plastic containers. And then the container itself is labeled like modeling miosis or DNA models. There's one for protein synthesis. So yes, I mean, there's a whole wall of kits that I have that I'm working through. So definitely some look like you could use the handouts with the students. They have a already made lesson,

Daylene Long (43:11):

And so it was helpful to have that little seat in the plastic container from the vendor that said where it was and how to use it and that kind of stuff. And I assume there was maybe like a URL that is

Janet Magargal (43:24):

Extremely helpful.

Janet Magargal (43:27):

I haven't seen any URLs that would be helpful and some things are missing. And that's been where I go to Google then, and I'm trying to like, okay, the name of the company, I was very frustrated. I couldn't find any student directions for, it was a cell membrane kit that I found that I absolutely loved, and it had the proteins embed it and I found it, but then I couldn't find any student interactions for a while. So it is very helpful when there's keys. Some of the kits are molecular model kits, and I might just not have had time to find them yet. They might be somewhere in the lab, but they'll use, okay, red for oxygen, white for hydrogen, and it's very helpful if I have a key. So I haven't found that key. There was an amino acid folding kit that had a key that was amazing. That might've been a 3D molecular design, but it was great and it was even laminated. So I don't know if the vendor laminated that and sent it with the kit or if that was something the previous teacher found. The key of this amino acid is hydrophobic. This amino acid is hydrophilic. These are non-polar polar, and it's a beautiful one page simple color coded and laminated. So keys are definitely helpful for the kits.

Daylene Long (45:02):

And those were in the plastic kits that you were getting, so it's sounds like somewhere, okay. Did you prefer it then when they were in the kit and you didn't have to go online? Or did you have a preference there?

Janet Magargal (45:16):

I like it one-stop shopping. So I liked it when I can open up a box and it was like, yeah, it was Christmas, because some of the boxes did have directions how to use the kit. It had the key already there. It was all together.

Daylene Long (45:34):

That sounds good. I want to ask Kimberly to join us again. We've just got five minutes left, and I want to see if she's got any follow-up questions for us.

Janet Magargal (45:43):

Okay.

Kimberly Herder (45:45):

Hi, this has been fantastic. I'm interested or would like to know what you could say in a couple of minutes about the school or your experience. I mean, you had a few years in a different school. What would you say, knowing the questions that Daylene asked, how in a nutshell would you answer that for your former school

Janet Magargal (46:18):

In terms of,

Daylene Long (46:19):

It might be too broad, Kim, you might want to narrow that down, Kim.

Kimberly Herder (46:27):

Well, in ordering supplies or kits, or thinking about the student population there, what would you answer differently or how would you answer differently? Some of the questions that we've asked when you looked at ordering or funding or how you made those decisions, what you were going to use

Janet Magargal (46:49):

In the previous school, it would have to be bilingual. I taught 90% of students that could not speak English, so I would definitely need content differentiated. Even at the high school level, you would need things not only translated into a different language, but a huge need for scaffolded material, differentiated, adapted, just different forms of reading levels. So that would definitely be a huge difference. I mean, even in the current school, it would be nice to have options for differentiation. Some students do need things scaffolded a little differently, so that would be a huge time saver. I mean, I would be surprised if you would talk to an educator that doesn't have a diverse group of students, no matter where you are. I mean, they may physically look more similar in some settings than others, but there's always the academic need for structuring things differently, providing maybe a graphic organizer, sentence starters, and anything, I guess along those lines to aid in support. I mean, it's the whole concept of equity. What one student might need might look very different for another student to still share and have same concept.

Daylene Long (48:33):

Kim, do you want to wrap us up with what happens next since we've just got a couple of minutes left.

Kimberly Herder (48:40):

So again, thank you very much for doing this. So in the next day, you'll be getting an email from me that will reference, oh, the $95 gift card that's being sent to you. We had said it was Amazon, it's actually a Visa gift card. Would that work?

Janet Magargal (49:00):

Absolutely.

Kimberly Herder (49:01):

Okay. And so we referencing that. I very much want to encourage you if you have additional thoughts that you ponder and want to get back to us, we'd like that very, very much. And then also to think about and respond in that way, if you would consider being involved in future studies that you may fall into a category of educator that we'd like to talk to.

Janet Magargal (49:33):

Okay.

Kimberly Herder (49:34):

Okay. Your

Janet Magargal (49:34):

Whole interest is still looking for, I mean, you said how to serve science educators better and support materials. That was what I think I wrote down, right?

Daylene Long (49:50):

Yeah. In general, that's all the research that we focus on. Sometimes it may have a very narrow bent to it. It may be that we're just talking to, we have a client that came to us that is physics in college, and so that's our focus. Or in this case it was life sciences. So in general, catapult X represents clients who are wanting to get teacher feedback, and that's what we really specialize is specifically in Science and STEM. And we only work with clients who provide incentives because we think it's important to make sure that teachers are valued as professionals. We only work with the Science and STEM community, and we really only work with organizations that are looking at it from the perspective of how do we make science education better for teachers? How do we make it better for students? So that's kind of how, as an organization, we've narrowed our focus because those are values that both Kim and I have and everybody that in Catapult that contributes has those values as well. So that's what we focus on.

Janet Magargal (51:10):

Oh, thank you. Oh, I love it. I really appreciate it. I mean, just to be heard, and I feel like I wasn't prepared enough, I wish I had more examples for you, just because I've taught so many years. It's like,

Daylene Long (51:26):

Well, and I

Janet Magargal (51:27):

May look

Daylene Long (51:27):

Through

Janet Magargal (51:28):

A

Daylene Long (51:28):

Transcript and follow up with you with a question or two if you don't mind that. And if you think of anything else as Kim mentioned, feel free to send us an email and you'll get two emails. You'll get the one with the incentive, and you'll get one from Kim. But it has been wonderful talking to you. And thank you so much for your enthusiasm with the hands-on is contagious. And I really appreciate, and Kim really appreciates everything that you do for science education, everything you do for students, that gets them excited about learning and becoming critical thinkers. So

Janet Magargal (52:12):

Thank you. That is my new passion. I mean, I just love where I am and I love, the girls are amazing where I am, and just their enthusiasm no matter what I do. So I think that's great that you said contagious, because we do, we feed off each other and they're like, what did we doing today? And they love coming in the room because of course when we did the speed dating organelles, I had to go all out and I put the candles, I brought in mints. So any lab we do, of course I am a little OCD, I take it to that level. So yeah, so I love the fact that you are supporting this passion of mine, and I'm learning the whole new curriculum approach through the year. So I definitely will have more to share as I go through the months.

Daylene Long (53:02):

And did I hear right, it's all if that's

Janet Magargal (53:03):

Helpful.

Daylene Long (53:04):

All girls in your school?

Janet Magargal (53:07):

Yes.

Daylene Long (53:08):

Okay. All right. That's good. Yes.

Janet Magargal (53:10):

I mean all girls. All girls private Catholic school. Okay. It's Kate. Yeah. Yeah.

Daylene Long (53:17):

Well thank you again Janet, and we'll be in touch.

Janet Magargal (53:21):

Okay. Thank you so much ladies.

Daylene Long (53:24):

Thank

Janet Magargal (53:24):

You. Bye-Bye bye.

Daylene Long (00:04):

Okay, Kim, tell us about our interview that we have coming up.

Kim Herder (00:10):

Reade Brooke or Burke, I believe it's said. She is a high school teacher of AP Environmental Science and Honors Biology in Richmond, Texas, which is just outside of Houston. She's down as both Finn and Carolina loyalist when we can find out. She's been teaching, it looks like she's been teaching there four years, but she may have been teaching nine altogether. What's come up in her little bio? Part of it is that it's a bilingual, quite a bit of the school is bilingual and assessments are really important for what they're doing. School-wide right now they're on an improvement

Daylene Long (01:04):

And she's ready to join us.

Kim Herder (01:05):

Okay. Hi. Oh, hi. Hi. Oh.

Daylene Long (01:39):

Oh. Did you freeze? Oh, there we go.

Kim Herder (01:44):

There we go.

Daylene Long (01:46):

Okay. You've got a good connection.

Reade Burke (01:49):

Yes, ma'am.

Daylene Long (01:50):

Good. Okay. Kim, you want to start us off?

Kim Herder (01:55):

Yeah, sure. It's Reid Burke. Is that what you say your name? Yes. Okay. Well, I'm Kim Herder and I'm with Daylene Long.

Daylene Long (02:03):

I got to get my name right there, Kim.

Kim Herder (02:05):

I say yeah. Okay. But I've got my tea and my Christmas cup, so hopefully that will help. So thank you for agreeing to do the interview. So it is life sciences and from what we understand that you're a AP environmental science and teacher, and so Daylene is going to conduct the survey. I will step off screen and handle the technical part of it. And also if there's something we need to dive a little deeper in, I'll kind of pop back on so we can kind of just jump right into it. I'd love for you to take just a minute and tell us a little bit about you and your school.

Reade Burke (02:54):

So I teach in the Metropolitan Houston area. We're a six a campus, so we're huge. I teach actually three different classes, two science, so AP environmental Science, and then I teach an accelerated freshman biology class. So we call it a C on our campus, but it's the accelerated level. And then I actually teach academic decathlon as well, but not a science class.

Daylene Long (03:16):

Wow. What is Academic Decathlon?

Reade Burke (03:19):

It's a national competition, so it has 10 different subject areas and then every year there's an evolving theme. So this year's theme is about humanity and technology. Today's actually our big competition, so I'll be headed there next. But students self-study with guidance to kind of explain humanity and technology and how that changed throughout the information age this year and the development of computers. So a little bit of how the mathematics of computer coding developed and the history of computers and how it developed from a hand image into the modern day computers we had, but also things like sci-fi, music, the basics of composition. So it's a complete integration of the 10 different subject areas. It's a real challenge for them.

Daylene Long (04:03):

It sounds like it. But also a really good exercise in critical thinking and in addressing issues that these kids are going to need to be able to think about for the rest of their lives, honestly, because just going to keep continuing to change the way the world works. So that sounds fascinating.

Reade Burke (04:26):

Yeah, it's really cool.

Daylene Long (04:28):

Yeah, just a couple of things. We are recording. I promise you won't end up on YouTube or America's Funniest videos or anything like that. It's just for note taking since we're doing 24 interviews and I want to make sure that I don't get anything messed up and that I've got all the details. Right. Let's see. So you're going to see us ask a lot of what and why questions. We really want to get an overview picture of how we can make life science materials, the buying process, the things that come with it better for teachers and better for students. So that's kind of what we're focused on and there's no right or wrong answers. And it helps some people if they think of it as we're like Kim and I are filming a documentary on the different products that you use and why you decided to go with those and what you like and what you wish you had. And so it's also a good time for you to just kind of directly give us feedback according to what it is you'd like to see. Any questions before I start?

Reade Burke (05:53):

No ma'am.

Daylene Long (05:54):

Okay. So you mentioned in your survey that you recently bought some life science materials. And tell me a little bit about that. What did the process look like? Deciding what you needed?

Reade Burke (06:11):

For my two different science courses at the beginning of the year, I'm in charge of my independent course and also our a c biology team. So I did some team ordering for AP environmental Science. They actually have done kind of a course redesign. So there were nine new labs in the last year and I've ordered new supplies for those. And then the last two weeks, college board released new labs for those as well. So now we're up to 30, which is a mess.

Daylene Long (06:41):

That's a lot of labs,

Reade Burke (06:43):

But it's an important way to make sure students have lab skills. They can independently go through and conduct a procedure, which is very difficult for these iPad kids. If you don't do 1, 2, 3 hands-on, they don't know how to do it. And that's something I thought they would be very self-guided in and they're worse than the students I saw five years ago. And so that's something we've taken a campus approach. We need more labs, they need more experience with this because I feel that our students are very interested in technical fields, so we want more exposure and they're great with hands-on things. So for environmental science, I actually want a grant. And that's something we ordered. We did some lab quests. I don't know if you're familiar with those.

Daylene Long (07:25):

I've heard of them, yes.

Reade Burke (07:28):

And so they plug into some probes that we had on campus. So we did some ordering of those. We bought with budget some additional units for our campus. And then we bought probes to replace the existing ones on campus. I have one right here. Some of the previous teachers didn't know these have to be stored in water or they cracked, we had to buy new ones. So I'm going through, again, very large campus, we've got a couple hundred of these and they have to be independently tested and then we have to figure out, okay, well what's a good class set size and go through and go through our inventory. And I mean, they're not overly priced, they're veneer these, but just going through the process and making sure how many for each one of our teachers to make sure we have enough hands-on sets for the kids. So that's been a big portion of our ordering. And

Daylene Long (08:18):

How did you decide that that's one of the things that you needed for these new labs?

Reade Burke (08:27):

I started wanting to do with environmental science, more labs outside. And so I found the LabQuest product because we can't take field trips, that's not time effective. And so I was like, I need something that allows me to go outside with kids and collect quantifiable data that they can take, analyze graph and do multiple rounds in a day or a week or month. And it needs to be a quick turnaround, not on block schedule. And that kind of really allowed that. And we've expanded on that since then with the different probeware for different activities.

Daylene Long (09:06):

Okay. Do you remember where you bought the sensors from?

Reade Burke (09:12):

We bought them from Flynn.

Daylene Long (09:15):

You bought them from Flynn. Okay. And why did you choose Flynn to buy the sensors through?

Reade Burke (09:23):

We have a limited list of who we are allowed to order through from our approved vendors. And of those, Flynn had the best pricing.

Daylene Long (09:31):

Okay. Do you remember any of the other approved vendors that you're allowed to work with?

Reade Burke (09:37):

Carolina and Flynn are who I primarily go through and then they've cut most of our chemical vendors. I know our physics teacher uses somebody else, but I don't recall who, but there's only four and Office Depot is the fourth one.

Daylene Long (09:51):

Okay. Alright, that's interesting. Between Carolina and Flynn, can you tell me any really positive experiences you've had with either or conversely, any negative experiences you've had with them?

Reade Burke (10:07):

I think they both do a good job at offering different supplies. I feel that Carolina's strength tends to be life science specific products, and Flynn does a better job with higher quality chemicals, especially in bulk sizes. And so that's how we tend to do our ordering. Both of them cons, they're overpriced for things that I consider simple house products. If I need 500 toothpicks, they're going to charge $10 and I can just go buy it at the store for 50 cents. Now I would have to pay that out of my own budget versus our campus budget, and that's another problem. Whereas teachers, we need to have access to things for reasonable pricing and soil is another example of that. We use a lot of soil and apes and the pricing on both of those websites is outrageous.

Daylene Long (10:56):

So you mentioned that one of your other approved vendors was Home Depot, but you're not going to be able to get soil at Home Depot. So where do you go for that?

Reade Burke (11:04):

Office? Depot.

Daylene Long (11:06):

Depot, office Depot. Sorry.

Reade Burke (11:08):

I buy it myself.

Daylene Long (11:11):

You do? It comes out of your pocket?

Reade Burke (11:13):

Yes.

Daylene Long (11:15):

Oh, that's unfortunate. We know that you teachers are always doing more with less, which is part of the reason that we're doing this research. Any other strengths or weaknesses that you can think of with Carolina or Flynn?

Reade Burke (11:33):

I mean, their websites are great. They're easy to use. Their representatives are usually pretty responsive. They do do a decent job, I feel for newer teachers with, Hey, I don't know what I'm doing at all. Here's this new lab. It comes in a kit, but once you've been teaching for a while, those are not the most cost effective options and they don't have a lot of refill options. So it kind of reaches the point where it's like, I wish I could just get these selected parts for a cost effective price.

Daylene Long (12:02):

Yeah. You mentioned two different budgets. You said something about a building budget and a department budget. Yes ma'am. Can you tell me a little bit about how those work? Who has to sign off on them, what the amount limits are and that kind of thing?

Reade Burke (12:21):

I don't have the limits for those. I just know that my department chair approves our science budget and he's given an amount from our campus principal. And I've never had anything that I've requested be denied for labs, which is a big benefit here because we do really value the strength of our science program. It's not very large if I'm being honest. I would imagine that we don't have more than probably five to $10,000. And for our campus size we have at least 40 different sections.

Daylene Long (12:53):

Wow, that's a lot. And then the other one was, so that's your department budget. And then do you have a budget for each class or for you as a science teacher or

Reade Burke (13:05):

No, it all comes everything. I'm a science teacher. Science comes out of that department budget, so that's our paper quotas, markers, everything we would need as a teacher unit.

Daylene Long (13:16):

Okay. Have you had any district level where the district has come in and say, Hey, we've got some extra funding, what do you need?

Reade Burke (13:25):

No ma'am.

Daylene Long (13:26):

Okay. All right. That's helpful. So on the sensors, do you remember just approximately when you had to refurbish them and check them out for which ones were cracked and stuff? Do you remember how many you bought or how much it cost?

Reade Burke (13:44):

I can pull it up.

Daylene Long (13:46):

That'd be great.

Reade Burke (13:47):

We've purchased, I think 16 and I have inventoried 47 this semester and they're all thrash, but we haven't replaced them yet.

Daylene Long (13:58):

Oh, okay. And you found the pricing to be better on Flynn is what I remember

Reade Burke (14:06):

For the originals, yes. We have not priced out all of the probes yet.

Daylene Long (14:14):

Okay. You mentioned Carolina again. Do you remember the last time you purchased from Carolina?

Reade Burke (14:21):

Last month.

Daylene Long (14:22):

Okay. What did you get?

Reade Burke (14:24):

We ordered BT blue Phenyl, Lene pink, new scalpel blades from Carolina. I ordered ghost shrimp for our aquatic tank. And then we ordered dissection specimens for a C biology and AP biology.

Daylene Long (14:44):

Do you remember which dissection specimens you ordered?

Reade Burke (14:48):

We order rats, earthworms, AP bio does pigs, the fetal pigs cow eyeballs, and that's all we ordered this year. Last year they did the fish for aquatics, but we have a different teacher for that this year.

Daylene Long (15:07):

If you needed different lab supplies, like you mentioned an aquatic tank or you needed a thermocycler or you needed, I don't know, biotechnology or anything like that, do you have a go-to vendor for those?

Reade Burke (15:27):

We do not. My partner teacher and I actually have won some grants for PCR and thermocyclers. We'd used the mini PCR tech, but that wasn't on the approved vendor list, so we had to have a special grant to win those. They weren't something we could buy.

Daylene Long (15:43):

Oh. So that's how that works. You needed a special grant because it wasn't on your approved vendor's list. Okay.

Reade Burke (15:50):

And it exceeded the value of our department as well.

Daylene Long (15:53):

Okay. Where did you first learn about the, you said mini PCR, correct? Yeah. Where did you first learn about mini PCR?

Reade Burke (16:03):

My partner teacher used to work in biotechnology. He did research on cancer and so he was familiar with them from maybe a conference he attended. I'm not sure.

Daylene Long (16:12):

Okay. That sounds interesting. I've heard a little bit about those from teachers. It seems like those are definitely becoming more popular.

Reade Burke (16:24):

They allow you to do them within the class period, which is really interesting. And so students get that hands-on and then if they go to take biology in college, they can kind of see how they work. And we've got some really quick water baths that heat up too. Good from Carolina.

Daylene Long (16:39):

The water bats from Carolina?

Reade Burke (16:41):

Yes.

Daylene Long (16:42):

Okay. And then, let's see. So we talked a little bit too about an overall objective of our research of wanting to make things better for you guys, wanting to see what's missing that's out there and maybe solve any points of frustration with the stuff that you recently purchased. Are there any supplemental materials or videos for you or videos for students or anything else that would make the teaching better or more enriching?

Reade Burke (17:21):

I haven't received any supplemental materials, so those would be fantastic. But just like anything for kids, especially in teaching now with levels, so like, hey, this is a probe, this is how we use it. And we could introduce it to let's say a freshman and then with somebody who's in a higher level science, like my juniors and seniors who are in college level classes, this is how we can apply the technology or this is how it's used as biotech in the field. Here's some activities that could be done. Anything that can save teachers time or some of our newer teachers who don't have the experience with teaching or with field research. Those are great things that we could be doing.

Daylene Long (17:59):

Okay. And you mentioned it being leveled is really important. Okay. Does the leveling correspond to any particular, excuse me, reading lexiles? Or is it just kind of thinking through an average freshman up to high school senior?

Reade Burke (18:22):

I think just leveling by grade would be a good place to start. But we also level here within our classes, we differentiate by student interest and need and kind of where they are on topics.

Daylene Long (18:34):

That's interesting. Tell me a little bit more about that.

Reade Burke (18:37):

So in my EP class, they'll take a pre-assessment. So if they're really good at a particular unit, they can kind of bypass the traditional lecture and focus more on application based. So maybe they'll skip to case studies or those who individual projects for application of technology. So we try and make it a little bit more individualized.

Daylene Long (18:57):

Who came up with the pretest that they take? Is that teachers or the district or how did you get those?

Reade Burke (19:05):

I made them, yeah. They're teachers. Yes.

Daylene Long (19:08):

And have you felt like that has been helping with engagement for students?

Reade Burke (19:14):

Yes. Our district really pushes the pre-assessment cycle, and so it's something they've encouraged us to do and to differentiate, but the work of that is done at the teacher level.

Daylene Long (19:22):

Okay. That's really interesting. What are some of the more unusual interests that you've had to adapt to or even the more common ones?

Reade Burke (19:34):

I've had some really interesting students over the years. So my AP class, that's my passion, so I really focus on it. And I actually, I work for college board also. I'm an AP reader, so I always try and innovate as they do. They share things with us. And so I always have two or three weeks after the AP test where you're like, what am I going to do? And so that's where I try and push them for, you took this class for a reason. You've hopefully gotten your AP credit. Where are we going to go from here? And so whatever their interest is in environmental science, which is a huge spectrum, I try and have them choose something and then do a project with it. So maybe an internship. So one year I had a girl who wanted to be an architect, so she went and found an architect in the Houston area who was focused on sustainable methods of forestry. She helped them find better lumberyards that used more harvestable timber that was better for the planet. And then they actually started changing the way that they designed buildings to use the better lumber in different ways and wrote a paper about it, which was really fascinating. And I don't know anything about architecture, but it was interesting to learn.

Daylene Long (20:46):

What a wonderful, that's really interesting. Any others that you can think of?

Reade Burke (20:55):

I've had some students do some really cool projects with Arduino, which is something they can code to do different things. A lot of students are focused on recycling efforts. Our campus does not because it's not cost effective in our region. We're trying to encourage our food and nutrition department to switch away from styrofoam trays in the lunchroom. So students are advocating for that. That's something they started this week. I had a student a few years ago who found a way to make reusable expo markers so you could just pull the tube out from the middle. And so they made a product design. They were like, teachers throw these away all the time, and they're not really recyclable. They get thrown out of the facilities. So I was like, mean, those are good ideas.

Daylene Long (21:39):

And those are the kind of global challenges that kids that are in high school right now are going to be needing to deal with. My son is 21 and he mentions from time to time that prior generations have ruined the entire planet for him and that he and his generation that are going to have to deal with a lot of the fallout from it. And I see that in a lot of the projects you're talking about there. So that's interesting. Let me see what else I've got on here. Okay. So we talked about video resources possibly for teachers or students just to kind of get them ready for what they're going to do. Do you use any simulations or interactive programs?

Reade Burke (22:30):

I have, but I've tried to switch this year away from as many of those as possible because I noticed through the covid years, kids have turned off when we use more computer-based. But that was something I used to emphasize and I just am kind of waiting to see if generationally we can integrate those back in.

Daylene Long (22:53):

That sounds smart, especially with the emphasis that you guys are really putting on those hands-on labs. So part of what came out of the survey was that it's really important to most biology, life science teachers that their vendors are reliable. And I wanted to get a sense from you of what reliability means.

Reade Burke (23:25):

Well, we've had some issues in the past with vendors where we order things and they're not coming in on time or they're not the items that we have ordered. And it's very difficult. We have classroom phones, but they don't ring because we're teaching. They're shut off by the district. It's sometimes difficult with any business for them to understand that while a school is kind of a business, we're not really someone that you can constantly be in contact with. So anytime there's an issue, it's not simple for us to fix. So for us, reliability would be if we're in contact with you and we have a problem, we need it to be fixed the first time. Not in the case. I had this year, the seventh time.

Daylene Long (24:12):

Oh my goodness. Do you mind telling me which vendor that was?

Reade Burke (24:15):

Was Flynn?

Daylene Long (24:18):

It was Flynn,

Reade Burke (24:20):

I think so. It might've been. I think it was fun. It was a probe, but they kept sending us the wrong one and it was a problem and they were like, we don't understand how. And I was like, neither do I. But also

Daylene Long (24:32):

I needed,

Reade Burke (24:33):

At this point, I needed the item months ago, had to bypass the activity and don't really have time to be shipping something back and forth.

Daylene Long (24:42):

Did they make it right for you in any way?

Reade Burke (24:44):

No.

Daylene Long (24:46):

Okay. Okay. That's interesting. So let's see what else. Are there any other things that as an AP bio teacher or an environmental science teacher that you thought science teacher, I wish we had this or this would make my teaching easier or better?

Reade Burke (25:10):

Just more offerings. Sometimes I feel like this could be my district's fault, but there's not enough offerings on the websites. My tank filter went out last week. Neither one of those vendors offers tank filters. So I'm trying to solder a new motor. There's no reason for me to be soldering a new motor on a tank filter. That's crazy. But I'm not going to go spend $120. It's a large filter on a new one. I don't really have that in my personal money to be spending on my job right now, but that's not what those companies specialize in. And there's probably someone else out there. But is that my district's fault or is it the website's fault? Not really, but that's the system that we're working in.

Daylene Long (25:53):

Because you're limited to three vendors?

Reade Burke (25:55):

Yes. Pasco is the other one, by the

Daylene Long (25:57):

Way. Oh, Pasco iss the other one. Okay. So you've got four vendors that you really go with there. Okay. I have gone through my questions. Kimberly, do you have any questions for re?

Kim Herder (26:16):

I do. I had know a little bit more when you were talking about leveling and scaffolding or for your students and how that happens or how you help students catch up is my first kind of thing. And then I want to ask about new teachers too once we've got that one covered.

Reade Burke (26:39):

Okay. So on any given unit leveling? Yeah.

Kim Herder (26:45):

Yeah.

Reade Burke (26:45):

So starting with my freshman class, usually how we train them up. So leveling, they'll come in, they'll take an assessment, just kind of figure out, they come from so many different feeder middle schools. Did you learn this? We have some students that come from a GT academy, so they've already learned an entire unit. Why am I going to sit a GT kid through a unit they've already learned they're going to be bored, they're going to be a distraction, or they're going to play a phone game and that's not what they're here for. So that kid is going to probably get curriculum compacting just to make sure they got the depth of the detail that I'm expecting at this level. And then they're going to maybe do a project, like I mentioned before, maybe a case study. It just depends on the specific unit we're doing.

Reade Burke (27:25):

We just finished genetics in freshmen. So one of my students who applies to that GT example, he did a case study where he wanted to learn about different types of cancer. He knows all the terms. They know about staging. They're familiar with those words, but he doesn't really know how do we make a diagnosis, how do doctors get to that process, how do they use imaging and how does that relate to the cell cycle unit that they just covered? What does that mean? What does it mean when we bypass those CDK signals? And so he was kind of connecting those different things and as long as he showed me every day on his learning plan, we made together, this is what I actually learned, he's fine. He didn't have to go do the vocabulary assignment my other students were doing because he already mastered that. You

Daylene Long (28:10):

Mentioned the term gt. What does that stand for?

Reade Burke (28:13):

Gifted and talented.

Daylene Long (28:15):

Gifted and talented. Okay, great. Thanks. Kim. You had other questions?

Kim Herder (28:21):

Well, one would be on the same sort of thing, but in remediation for those kids who are not, how do you handle that? Or is there anything that can be done a vendor could do that would address that?

Reade Burke (28:39):

There's a ton for remediation. We use a couple of different things on campus for remediation. We use a program called Edgenuity for students who are failing courses. But on the classroom level, that really depends on the teachers. There's a ton of different things you can buy from software to just information packages, but it depends. Are they not understanding a unit? Is the teacher catching it before the test? After the test? So we do RTI on our campus, so trying to scaffold them up just depending on when they're failing, hopefully before December, because that's kind of a big checkpoint. As far as what could a vendor do? It just kind of depends on the teaching style in my opinion. There are some teachers that flourish really well with prepackaged information and they can apply that to their students. I find that, I mean, I work at a very multicultural school. We have so many different students with different learning styles. It's hard to kind of a one size fits all thing that would be cost effective and would work with me and all of my students that I could get run up the ladder to get purchased.

Kim Herder (29:51):

Is language an issue?

Reade Burke (29:54):

At our campus, we have over 60 languages spoken, so yes.

Daylene Long (29:59):

You mentioned run up the ladder ladder to get purchased. What does that look like

Reade Burke (30:05):

For me to get something purchased that would be curriculum based, I would have to ask the district office about it because things that are not purchased that are curriculum have to go for me through science curriculum. And then it would have to be approved on a campus level as well

Daylene Long (30:20):

That include supplemental curricular materials

Reade Burke (30:24):

If it needed to be purchased. Yes.

Daylene Long (30:26):

Okay. I had one other question too about are there any particular vendors that you work with that you feel particularly loyal to?

Reade Burke (30:37):

No.

Daylene Long (30:38):

Okay. Kimberly, anything else

Kim Herder (30:43):

From you? It was on the teaching. I mean you come across and I'm sure I would love to be in your classroom. I mean, I would love to be. Yeah. And I'm hoping that they've cloned you and all the teachers are of your caliber. If that's not the case, perhaps you could tell us how you'd be answering these questions to facilitate another teacher's classroom in their ordering.

Reade Burke (31:16):

I don't really know how their classrooms work. I mean, I do the ordering for our biology team, so the specimens that we order, that's not just for me, that's for our entire biology team of both levels. The on-level biology and the accelerated course. So everyone's using those. I'm not sure that they do a lot of other labs that involve chemicals or things that are ordered. I know they do activities and things with paper that are cut out and they do a lot of manipulatives and paper-based puzzles. But I'm not sure what else is happening because nothing else is getting ordered because that goes through me to our department chair because our particular team is not so good with Excel. So I manage that to help out. How else would they do ordering? I don't know. I know our chem teacher does a lot of chemistry supplies. She also teaches AP chemistry. And so there's a lot of those labs going on, but those are prescribed by college board. I don't know if there's anything that is an extension of those activities.

Daylene Long (32:19):

Okay. Just wrapping it up, is there anything else that you would like us to know? If you were talking directly to the head of big science education companies, is there anything you would like them to know?

Reade Burke (32:36):

I would love for them to have conversations with districts to explain the importance of science curriculum. Because sometimes it's difficult for teachers to advocate for budgets because science is not going to be as cheap as social studies. Those are books. History hasn't changed, and those books are going to be a fixed cost, but eventually I'm going to need more fennel failing. And that's going to be something that is consistent. And so sometimes, and this is true with a lot of my friends in teaching across multiple districts, public and private charter schools, they don't understand that you can't just take your budget and divide it across departments. Like all departments are not created equal. And I feel that our society is moving towards STEM. That has been a 15-year-old shift. And so if we want to continue to have research for Covid and push for these things, we need to have children interested in bench based research. And if they don't have exposure to it at 15 and they have an attention span built on TikTok, they're not going to have the attention to solve cancer to find RNA. They're not going to be able to do it. So we really need to have the support here for those long-term changes.

Daylene Long (33:55):

That's really helpful. That's really helpful to know.

Kim Herder (33:59):

Oh, sorry, you just said binge based research.

Reade Burke (34:03):

Binge bench lab. Bench. Oh,

Kim Herder (34:06):

Bench. I heard binge. And I thought that is a brilliant saying that you have to hit it and you have to keep going through it. And I was like, I know. Well, you can point it now. Your thing is binge based research. Okay.

Reade Burke (34:24):

I'll copyright.

Daylene Long (34:27):

Kim, do you want to go ahead and let Reid know just next steps and stuff? We're doing really well on time, but I want to make sure we're being respectful since she's got a bunch of stuff going on today.

Kim Herder (34:38):

Yes. So next you'll get a email from me, whether it's tonight, probably tomorrow that we'll have that. We'll wrap things up a little bit. We had put in, or in your invitation it said a $95 gift card will be sent to you. We had put Amazon on that. It's actually a Visa gift card. Is that okay?

Reade Burke (34:59):

That's fine. Thank you.

Kim Herder (35:00):

Okay. And so that will actually come under from DA's email address In my email. I'll ask a couple of different things that if you haven't, if anything tonight or the next week or whatever it is, if you have other information or ideas that you would like us to pass on or add into the research, let us know on that. And then also, if you'd like to be a part of any other surveys, research that fits into our models, if you'd be interested, that would be fantastic.

Daylene Long (35:41):

Your gift certificate should come from me today. If for some reason by tomorrow you don't get it, follow up to Kim's email or check your spam box or those kinds of things. But it comes from an app that's called Tremendous and it gives you the choice of the Visa gift card or a Target gift card or a couple of other things as well. Alright, well thank you so much. And if you follow up and you think of anything that you're, you would really like people who can make changes to what's available for science teachers to know, please feel free to reach out at any time.

Kim Herder (36:24):

Yes. Thank you so much.

Daylene Long (36:26):

Thank you.

Kim Herder (36:27):

And have fun tonight. My gosh. That just blow your mind.

Daylene Long (36:34):

All right, Kim, do you want to stay on for just a minute? Yep. Okay. I'm.

Speaker 1 (00:02):

Okay. Start to tell us about Kirsten or Kristen?

Speaker 2 (00:07):

Kirsten.

Speaker 1 (00:09):

Kirsten. Okay.

Speaker 2 (00:12):

So she's been with the Cleveland Metro School District for 26 plus years. First 13 years she was in curriculum design biology, and then she taught biology, chemistry, life sciences, forensics. 12 years ago, she became the district administrator for curriculum and instruction for science education seventh through 12th grades, and she was part of the adoption of the io Ohio Learning Standards. Oh, sorry. Yeah. Cleveland, if I didn't say that, she's down and we have her as a Carolina loyalist, but what I can also fray and wards seem to be favorites, but Okay. Back to,

Speaker 1 (01:07):

She's ready to join us.

Speaker 3 (01:09):

Okay.

Speaker 1 (01:10):

So that's a cute little mamo.

Speaker 2 (01:23):

Very good.

Speaker 1 (01:27):

Hello, how are you?

Speaker 3 (01:29):

Good. Hi.

Speaker 1 (01:31):

Good. Did you pronounce your name Kirsten or Kirsten or

Speaker 3 (01:38):

Kirsten? Yeah, Kirsten.

Speaker 1 (01:39):

Okay.

Speaker 2 (01:41):

Ann MoVI.

Speaker 3 (01:43):

Yes.

Speaker 2 (01:43):

Okay. Well, I'm Kim Herder and also with Daylene Long, and we're very excited that you're here, and I was pretty darn excited doing a little research and saw your video from back in May on the STEAM program down on at the Waterfront it looks like.

Speaker 3 (02:05):

Yes, yes, yes. So it's a huge, huge thing we do every year in cooperation with the Great Lake Science Center and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. So what you saw was the STEM side of things over the rock hall. They have huge art performances and art displays, and we average between four and 5,000 attendees.

Speaker 1 (02:30):

Wow. That's amazing. Yeah. How did you start getting involved with that?

Speaker 3 (02:37):

Because I'm the science person.

Speaker 1 (02:40):

Okay.

Speaker 3 (02:41):

So yeah. So my role with CMSD, you know what, I'm going to turn this background off. I'm just going to do a blur. Okay. So my job title has changed a couple of times, but it's still the same role. So what I do is oversee science education for seventh through 12th grade for Cleveland Municipal School District as part of STEM. I came in to help support bringing in science projects, schools that were doing science projects and things into the rock your world with Steam. Also, I have a knack of being a party planner and an event planner.

Speaker 1 (03:30):

I love that.

Speaker 3 (03:32):

So they tap on my, not freaking out when they say, well, we like to shoot for 5,000 people this year. Okay, no problem.

Speaker 1 (03:42):

Very cool. So let's see. Kim, did you have any other

Speaker 2 (03:51):

Questions?

Speaker 1 (03:51):

Was before started.

Speaker 2 (03:52):

I was just going to say thank you for being here first off and looking through. I'm just excited to be in your presence and what we're going to learn from you today. But I am going to step off camera and do the background tech stuff and I'll pop in if there's something that needs to be adjusted or if there's a question that might need a little more information on it. Okay. Okay. Thank you so much for being here.

Speaker 3 (04:25):

You're welcome. Well,

Speaker 1 (04:26):

First of all, Kristen, she has never said to me that she was excited just to be in my presence. So I want to just kind of put that out there and I've known her for a while, so I'm a little jealous. Let me go over just some of the basics. We are recording this today. It's only for note taking purposes, so I don't have to remember everything. You won't end up on YouTube and I won't ask you to do a TikTok dance or anything like that. So we're all good. Our goal today really is to, we want to hear from educators. We want to amplify the educator voices in terms of companies that supply materials and educational curricular materials to science educators. It's really your chance to be able to talk directly to those product and marketing development teams.

Speaker 1 (05:26):

And we want to understand in the beginning, first what your process looks like when you're looking to buy something for your classroom. And then we'll have a chance at the end for you to just tell us about things that you think might be missing. We are going to ask a lot of what and why questions. It helps people to think of us as kind of filming a documentary. We're going to ask a lot of questions along the, just so I can make sure I better understand where you're coming from. No right or wrong answers. So having said that, you mentioned in your survey that you had at least within the last six months or so, sorry, that's my cat joining our call. In the last six months or so, you've bought materials for life sciences?

Speaker 3 (06:24):

Yes.

Speaker 1 (06:24):

Okay. Tell me a little bit about that. How did you determine what you needed to buy?

Speaker 3 (06:32):

So just so you know, our school district uses a portfolio model for purchasing. So a lot of the purchasing is left up at the school level. So we're budgets and they do their own purchasing. So a lot of what happens within that. So there's tiers of purchasing, there's district level purchasing, so for example, textbooks that would be at the district level. And then in terms of keeping up with labs and lab supplies or programming that is around specific themes for a school. We have two schools of health and medicine, so they have a slightly different theme. So there's that. And so what often happens is they come to me for recommendations. What is it that we're trying to get this program up and running? What's the basic materials that we're going to need? Can you give us some recommendations for vendors? Safety things? Every once in a while we're doing a special project and we could use some support around, again, purchasing to the point where a school had gone down to the wire and through some kind of funding they had, I think it was $60,000 to spend on science equipment and basically we had to spend in 48 hours or they were going to lose that funding.

Speaker 1 (08:05):

Oh my gosh. How did you deal with that?

Speaker 3 (08:08):

Well, so I got on the phone, I called the teachers because to me it's very, very important to get the actual instructor's input instead of me just randomly saying, this is what you're going to need. They were able to join me on teams on a Sunday night, and I said, we opted to go through a vendor school specialty, which is a one-stop shop for us, so that we didn't have to look at a lot of different vendors because we knew we had to go. It wasn't necessarily shopping for the best price, but that's what we were doing.

Speaker 3 (08:46):

And so that's what we did, and we went through class by class, item by item, what it was that they were looking for. So we looked at general equipment. Again, life science are going to need microscopes and slides and glassware, and I didn't put on that. We looked at probes, but they did for pH and things. So a lot of my most recent purchases that would be for life science also, it's hard for me to tease that out from the general science equipment that we're doing. Right. So some specific things like that. And then of course we look at things like for the life sciences, some of the kit based programs that are there around genetics, things that we can get that are models, life science models. One teacher was really interested in getting some of the cross section of a flower, those traditional cross section of the cell models.

Speaker 3 (09:54):

So I've had, I've had several schools that have started anatomy and physiology programs, and so we've had everything from the one school that was very much a little bit more traditional, and they needed a skeleton and dissection materials because they were doing some survey things to a program that was three years in the making, which is doing virtual with ocular devices. So we had to purchase laptops that had high resolution to be able to do the 3D imaging, and that's in partnership with the Cleveland Clinic. So you can imagine what that programming is, so those kids are actually getting the same experience as the folks that are actually going to medical school.

Speaker 1 (10:49):

So just a couple of questions. In your role in advising other teachers on what to purchase, is that because you are the science department chair or just because you're experienced teacher? Or why do they come to you?

Speaker 3 (11:07):

Well, experienced teacher, so I was a classroom teacher for 13 years within the district, and I've been in this current role almost as long. So my title is program manager. We used to be content, what was it? Flexible content experts than we were content managers. So now this is more of a generic term, but they come to me, one because I'm knowledgeable, and two, before we went to the portfolio model, I was the person that was doing a lot of the ordering. So I have those connections to sales reps, companies, et cetera. I know a little bit about the ins and outs of when they're large scale purchasing. We have a purchasing department that you need to put in three quotes, those kinds of things. So just helping them manage the system as well.

Speaker 1 (12:04):

Okay. So is your role as a program manager at the building level or at the district level?

Speaker 3 (12:09):

At the district level. Okay.

Speaker 1 (12:12):

And then I am not super familiar with a portfolio model. Can you explain a little bit what that is?

Speaker 3 (12:20):

So what the portfolio model does is it gives schools autonomy. So basically you have building leadership, your principal and others, that when they are received their buck, and it's based on the number of students that are enrolled in the school. And then there's tiers within services that students need. So a student who is an English language learner has more funding allocated to them. A student who is identified as special needs or gifted has more funding allocated to them. If they're considered twice exceptional, so they are an English language learner and they're special ed or gifted, then there's more funding allocated. So what that allows for is schools to really tailor their content and their instruction to the needs and wants of the community.

Speaker 3 (13:25):

So that's really more at the K eight level. At the high school level, we are also school of choice. So you don't go to your neighborhood school? Currently we're doing school choice right now. So families get to choose which schools that they want to attend based on themes that we have present. So we have Cleveland School of the Arts, we have science and Medicine, architecture and Design IT Digital arts, which is more video programming. We have Davis Aerospace and Maritime when we last year, so it was the first time we actually had two students who were able to graduate with their pilot's licensing.

Speaker 1 (14:07):

Wow.

Speaker 3 (14:08):

My gosh.

Speaker 1 (14:09):

Don't tell my son that he wants to be a pilot. It's a lot of money to do that if you're not doing it in a program like you just described.

Speaker 3 (14:20):

Exactly. Exactly. So within their budgeting, they're able to budget for instructors to instruct the specialized programming and to purchase materials to support that kind of programming. Now sometimes, sometimes that programming is up and beyond what would be the school budget. So for example, to do the virtual Anatomy and physiology lab, it was a district input of over probably $150,000 because we completely redesigned the space to be able to handle not only the laptops, but also the ocular devices for the students. And that is, I think money well invested because it's a three year program, because students go have a first year, second year, third year. So they do some of the more traditional dissection, and then they do the virtual piece where, I mean, they're literally looking at a virtual model of a human being where they're doing.

Speaker 1 (15:33):

So it's vr, it's virtual reality where they've got the headsets

Speaker 3 (15:37):

Virtual, where they have the headsets,

Speaker 1 (15:40):

Who runs that program. That sounds really cool.

Speaker 3 (15:44):

So that is at John Hay Science and Medicine, and the teacher that's involved is Wilmar Bettencourt, but we're in partnership with the Cleveland Clinic, so they're providing us the software piece of it. We had to provide the hardware piece of it, and then her students are able to go over to the, so Cleveland Clinic partners with Case Western Reserve Medical School. So there's that education piece. So our students are able to go over to the clinic, it depends on which year of the program they're in, but to do observation, to do some activities over there, which eventually leads to internships, which eventually could either lead to Pathways right into jobs or into the medical school.

Speaker 1 (16:37):

So you started to talk a little bit about what's the average or just a typical school budget at the building level in your district?

Speaker 3 (16:50):

Oh, I don't know. So usually you're looking at probably between 15 and $1,900 per student average. Average elementary school is around 300 students, so that's kind of the baseline, and then it moves up, but that's for

Speaker 1 (17:10):

All their stuff.

Speaker 3 (17:12):

That's for all right. So part of the struggle is along with a lot of other urban districts is the primary focus is usually on literacy and math. So in order to get that budgeting in for science, you may have schools and principals that understand the importance of science as part of that STEM umbrella, and they'll budget. So I'm going to say sometimes it's $5 a year. They have as little as $500 a year to maybe, I'm going to say maybe up to $5,000 a year in order to keep resupplying the consumable pieces.

Speaker 1 (18:05):

And then those bigger pieces come through you at the district for things like the academy program and stuff. That makes sense. So you mentioned that one big order that you did everything with school specialty, it was last minute, and you wanted to just have one vendor that you went with. Are they a primary vendor for you, or was it just in that particular circumstance? No,

Speaker 3 (18:32):

I really like them because they are one-stop shopping, and so I'm sure this is where the question is going to be. Their sales rep for them is a bit old school. She's very hands on. She follows up. I'm on her speed dial, she's on my speed dial. If I call her, honestly, if she doesn't pick up, she calls me back within an hour. Emails are answered very, very quickly. That kind of thing. They send people out to help with setup, like, so if we buy equipment or there's something that requires a little bit of knowledge behind it, they will send people out to train the teachers on how to use it. We purchased, we gave out STEM kits during the rocker world with Steam, and we purchased that through them, and they sent out an entire staff to help distribute.

Speaker 1 (19:32):

Oh,

Speaker 3 (19:32):

Wow. These kits. So in terms of customer service, that's why they tend to be one of my go-tos, one stop shopping, one of my go-tos. Unfortunately, if we're needing to do really quick overnight or I mean we needed it back in the buildings in a couple of days. We've been depending on Amazon quite a bit, and I'm hearing a lot of people are doing that as well.

Speaker 1 (19:57):

Yeah. So do you have a business account with them or a school account with them? How does that work?

Speaker 3 (20:05):

So from my end, I turn that over to our support people. I will say, here's the call number, here's the price price item from Amazon, and then it goes through our purchasing department. So I'm going to assume, yes, we've got a business account, but generally, I mean, that means I have those items in my hands within Amazon Prime, within usually a couple of days,

Speaker 1 (20:32):

But that part goes through the purchasing department.

Speaker 3 (20:36):

Okay. That makes sense. Right.

Speaker 1 (20:38):

Do you have other favorite vendors or do you have ones that you won't use for a reason?

Speaker 3 (20:49):

I can't say there's anybody that I've come across that I won't use. Wards has always been, GoodCo is always good for things. Carolina has kind of fallen a little off the path a little bit. School specialty is absorbed. A lot of different companies where we used to purchase the kits like lab aids,

Speaker 3 (21:20):

And they have that all under their umbrella. Another group that we, I'm going to say within the last several years, we did a large scale purchase through was STEM Scopes. And again, really excellent program in terms of kit based science for you have the lessons, you have the plans. It was in alignment with our literacy goals and our math goals. And then you had all the supplies that you needed to run the lab experiment that they had. Teachers did not have to go out, and there's always that you have to go purchase a celery or something like that. There was none to very little of outside of Outof pocket needing to purchase in order to run the lab. So that they're a good company too, for high-end things for chemistry and that I might go to Fisher for the chemicals or Sigma

Speaker 1 (22:27):

Fisher or Sigma. You didn't mention Flynn in any of that. Do you use Flynn for

Speaker 3 (22:32):

Yeah, I do use Flynn, but Flynn tends to outprice themselves in comparison to Fisher. I mean

Speaker 1 (22:42):

Out-priced themselves

Speaker 3 (22:44):

Well, so Fisher tends to be a little bit lower costs than some of the other ones because of there's purchase power and they work with the schools in order to lower their cost, lower their costs. Now, in my previous life, when I was a lab technician at the University of Toledo, Flynn was one of my go-tos, Sigma and Flynn, because honestly did cost a little bit more, but the quality was better in terms of the chemical

Speaker 1 (23:22):

With Sigma or with Flynn.

Speaker 3 (23:24):

With Flynn.

Speaker 1 (23:25):

With Flynn, the quality was a little bit better.

Speaker 3 (23:27):

Okay. Better. Yeah. And then there were things that I could not purchase through Flynn at that time that I purchased through Sigma that Sigma only carried, so some of their enzymes and things like that. So again,

Speaker 1 (23:42):

Okay. You mentioned that Carolina's kind of fallen off. What happened there?

Speaker 3 (23:47):

Well, and this goes back a ways where they got some bad press about how they were treating their live specimens before they were going into being dissection materials. So there was some bad press about how they were going about humanely sacrificing animals in order to be dissection specimens. And so there was some feedback on that. The other thing is too, through Carolina, we've gone away from doing dissection. Ohio does not have dissection as part of their biology standards anymore. So again, a lot of the companies that primarily focus on live and dissection materials, just not using as frequently.

Speaker 1 (24:47):

Okay. You said you're in Toledo, right?

Speaker 3 (24:53):

I'm in Cleveland, yeah.

Speaker 1 (24:54):

You're in Cleveland, okay.

Speaker 3 (24:55):

Currently Cleveland,

Speaker 1 (24:56):

Yeah. Okay. So is that true for Cleveland? Is it true for all of Ohio? Is the whole state moving away from dissection?

Speaker 3 (25:06):

Yeah, so in the biology standards for the science biology standards, the state standards dissection has not been part of the curriculum for, I'm going to say almost 15 years now.

Speaker 1 (25:18):

Oh, wow. Okay.

Speaker 3 (25:20):

So even when I was still in the classroom, remember I used to do these when I was teaching survey anatomy and physiology courses where you start with the earthworm and you work your way up to the fetal pig

Speaker 1 (25:37):

And there's a cat somewhere in there between

Speaker 3 (25:39):

Right, right. Or cats. Rats or the eyeball or the cow's heart. Yeah. So in general, in the biology classes, they no longer do that. Some of my teachers that are teaching more specialized curriculum or a biology two course or the anatomy and physiology or even forensics have brought back dissection. But I spoke with a colleague at one of the universities and he was saying even at the universities in their life science survey courses, their one oh ones, he said they've really removed dissection out of the curriculum. They found it. It's become very costly,

Speaker 1 (26:31):

The thing. But it sounds like the virtual dissection is not super inexpensive either

Speaker 3 (26:38):

To set up. No, but there's a lot of great programs out there that aren't that bad with the 3D. So when I'm talking about that, the virtual, they actually have the gloves. So not only are they seeing it, but they can actually feel through the gloves it appears. Oh, wow. Yeah. So there's a thing where you can see the heart beating. It looks like you have a real human heart, and through the gloves you can actually feel it.

Speaker 1 (27:09):

Oh my goodness.

Speaker 3 (27:11):

Yeah.

Speaker 1 (27:12):

Oh, students must love

Speaker 3 (27:15):

That. That's why that's at that end spectrum.

Speaker 1 (27:19):

Okay, that makes sense Now, okay, let's see. You had mentioned too that Carolina had gotten some bad press around the treatment of the specimens.

Speaker 3 (27:31):

Right.

Speaker 1 (27:32):

Do you remember how long ago that was? And did that affect the decisions in Ohio in general, or was that a separate?

Speaker 3 (27:44):

So it affected my decision as a program manager as to who I wanted to go through. Okay. Alright. And I'm going to say it had to have been about a decade ago that that occurred also. So just also at the same time, PETA had come in to the district and was inquiring about our dissection. I was brand new on the job when this happened, and so about our dissection policies and our procedures and who were we getting our specimens from? And so in order to not get some bad press, which was a good thing, we really clarified what our protocols were. So because the state at that point, like I said, had moved away from dissection being required as part of biology, I was able to say that. So only students who are choosing to enter into those specialty courses know ahead of time going in that dissection is going to occur and that they know ahead of time. And if that's something that they don't want to do, it is not a core science course like biology is that they have to take. If it was part of that, then I have to be able to provide and equal process that isn't dealing with dissection. So that virtual piece, so something that's the equivalent of them going through it,

Speaker 1 (29:25):

Is that like a state or district mandate that you've got to be able to, okay. It is.

Speaker 3 (29:31):

Yeah,

Speaker 1 (29:31):

I was wondering about that.

Speaker 3 (29:34):

So even when I was at the University of Toledo, and that was almost 30 years ago, we had policies in place because you would have students that maybe were pregnant and could not inhale the fumes in those general survey courses or might be allergic. A lot of the injection where they do so that you can tell the difference between the blue vein and the veins and the arteries are latex. So we had to be mindful of allergies, so we always had something in place, but we just then added that layer of, I object to this on the grounds of personal beliefs because I'm vegan, vegetarian, those kinds of things.

Speaker 1 (30:24):

Well, that's interesting. Do you guys ever at the building level work with material review committees? Where if you're, and how did those work? I've always wondered how the schools work with the districts, works with the school board, and how does that all work together?

Speaker 3 (30:45):

So when we do review, what I do is I put out an invite to, so whatever grade level it is for whatever content level, I put an invite out to all the teachers in the district. So you have to keep in mind we're about 40,000 students. So we have that many teachers and I will cap it. I say, I've got 25 slots, and I will often ask for, you must be currently teaching that subject and you need to have been teaching the subject for a minimum of three years to be part of the selection committee. Then we bring them in, I bring them in, we have a rubric, and usually what I do is the state provides a high quality materials review rubric. I'll adapt it maybe a little bit to specific needs for Cleveland. We go over that, and then I bring the vendors in, the vendors to go through their dog and pony show, and I have the teachers independently complete the rubric, submit the rubric, and then based on their feedback, I then submit, usually it's three, my top five, I'll narrow down top five, top three, and then it goes on to our chief academic officer and the purchasing to make the final decision.

Speaker 1 (32:22):

Okay.

Speaker 3 (32:23):

Yeah.

Speaker 1 (32:25):

How did they make those finals decisions? If you've got three really good candidates, what are they looking at?

Speaker 3 (32:34):

Honestly, I mean first and foremost is usually price. So going to look at price, they're going to look at what kind of services being provided. So is shipping included in that price? Is shipping additional, are they only able to ship to a central location or can they ship to the individual schools? Shipping to individual schools puts you up in a different bracket. And then usually when I'm working with those vendors, I work on what kind of training and professional development is included in this bundled pricing that we're getting. And so for example, the last textbook type purchase I negotiated so that we had at least three years of professional development that was available because we get new teachers in, teachers switch subjects.

Speaker 3 (33:40):

So I needed to be able to redo the come see McGraw Hill 1 0 1 again to the teacher maybe in that third year saying, now here we are. You've had two years to get used to this product. Now we're going to take a deep dive into how you can really pump up your teaching experience. So to me, that's really important. Again, some of that relationship between the sales reps and the vendors is also very, very important. So like you said, usually I get it down to top three, break it down to top, maybe top two, and then price point. But then it is that customer service experience.

Speaker 1 (34:29):

And on the PD side of things, do you guys have a preference for in-person or virtual or videos or webinars, or how does that

Speaker 3 (34:42):

I was going to say pre pandemic, we wanted it in person. The world has changed. I really like to have the ability to offer it because people learn differently. So I like being able to have the in-person option alive, virtual, this is great, but then also something that might be recorded for those that can watch a video and pick things up quickly, particularly if we're talking about a textbook or whatever. In general science teacher, they love the hands-on, particularly if we're doing labs, they want to get in and they want to use the equipment. So that's the part that they like the in-person pieces for. But if we're just going over, here's the components of your digital textbook and here's how you access it that they prefer virtual or webinar.

Speaker 1 (35:44):

Okay. So you mentioned shipping, you mentioned discounts and how PD is incorporated. Is there anything else that vendors offer for you guys at the district that you kind of perk up and go, oh wow, that's awesome.

Speaker 3 (36:02):

Yeah, so always any kind of freebies that they add on. So we did, and I know it's not within your six month range, but when we did our textbook purchase, I pushed for all digital. This was pre pandemic, so I was good for me, I'm tooting my own horn. You were

Speaker 1 (36:30):

Seeing into the future

Speaker 3 (36:33):

My colleague, because we were able to bundle science and social studies together, more purchase power kept saying we still need to do a traditional paper textbook. And so in our purchase, we got the PD six years of this digital licensing, unlimited access for teachers to the digital tes. And then we were able to get what they threw in for free was class sets of textbooks. So that was really the tipping point between the one vendor and the vendor that we went with is they were able to accommodate my six core content and the four social studies core content classes plus the textbooks. The other vendor had a little bit more tech bells and whistles, like those 3D goggles and things that they were willing to throw in, but we opted to go with a little bit more traditional just because we were baby steps transitioning into this realm of being mostly digital.

Speaker 1 (37:54):

And is there anything you wish they would throw in? I've talked to some people that like the video trainings or the lab prep for students that are video-based or just anything else that you think, oh, I wish somebody would do this.

Speaker 3 (38:12):

Yeah. So to most of who I've been working with are doing the asynchronous learning series. So the teachers can do that. So most of them are offering that. I'm actually wishing that more of them would go back to doing some of the in-person. But one of the vendors that I worked with when we were transitioning to that digital work, I asked if they would be willing to do small cohorts of students, that we could have student ambassadors, and they were willing to come in and work with students rather than just the teachers. So what we were able to do was on a professional development, I was able to pull teachers out of the classroom. The teachers came, they were allowed to select between three and five students to be their student ambassadors. The teachers went and did the teacher training, and we took the students in and we demoed everything from the student lens about how they would submit their homework and how they would do all of that kind of stuff. And what that did is hold the teachers more accountable to actually using the digital materials,

Speaker 1 (39:32):

But it also sets those students up as leaders and to be able to be role models. And so it takes some pressure off of the teacher because you can go to another student and say, how do I do this?

Speaker 3 (39:46):

That's easier.

Speaker 1 (39:47):

That is really smart.

Speaker 3 (39:51):

That was the goal. We were laughing. I said there was always that kid, I just remember when I was first teaching that could thread the film through the projector when you got stuck. So this is just at a different level now. We've got that kid that's there that a little tech savvy and says, here, this is how you send this as an attachment. This is how you download this. This is how you access that video.

Speaker 1 (40:19):

Did you have a name for it? These kids, did you call them student ambassadors or was it

Speaker 3 (40:24):

Yeah, we called them our champions. They were our student champions.

Speaker 1 (40:28):

Okay, that's interesting. My son did something similar. His school had a makerspace and teams of students would learn how to do large format printing or the 3D printers, and they did it all through their time at the school and then they could train the next cohort that was coming in. So it's similar, but theirs was really focused on the makerspace.

Speaker 3 (40:54):

So many vendors, they focus on the teacher at the teacher level. So I would love to see things that they offer at the student level and then in the other direction. A lot of times we have the building leadership and the principals, they also would like to see things, but they need to see it through their lens. They're not necessarily a practitioner, but they need to know when they're walking into that life science classroom what it is that they should be observing.

Speaker 1 (41:27):

Okay. Okay. That's interesting. So what kind of materials would support the principal in understanding when they walk into the class, what they're seeing?

Speaker 3 (41:40):

When I walk teachers through the lab, we'll do a bit of a modified lab, but they actually go through it as if they're the students so that they see all of it. Principals don't need an hour, hour and a half dive like that. They need a 15 minute overview of if you're coming in and Kirsten is using this genetics kit, what you should see is student groups working with these materials to do build this. This is what you should see when you're going in. If you're going into the anatomy and physiology class, the virtual physiology, you may see a lot of kids with goggles just waving their hands around and what is it that they're doing. But then too, the flip side of it is that in terms of when they're making their budgeting decisions need to do some ooh off for those principals so that when a science teacher comes in all excited about it, that the principal can say, oh, was that the 3D heart that was beating right now? Okay, I'm willing to budget for that. Or I saw that really awesome genetics kit where the kids were building their puppies or whatever it was that they were doing.

Speaker 1 (43:09):

That's really interesting. Now, did they ever need, probably not for the walkthrough, but did the principals or the district level people, do you ever need something that talks about how the materials are based on research-based learning practices or efficacy studies, or are those things useful?

Speaker 3 (43:33):

Those things are very useful in terms of picking what we're choosing to purchase.

Speaker 1 (43:39):

Okay.

Speaker 3 (43:40):

But in terms of the day-to-day walkthrough, not so much. So along with that portfolio piece, and the reason that they call the teachers will call me, but principals will too, is that kind of menu of options. So the idea is that we've done that research for them and here's maybe the top five choices that we can give them. Okay. Or if they come to me with something maybe I'm not familiar with, because there's so much out there that I can then go and do that legwork for them so that that's not on their plate. And I can say, okay, so I've done this research, I called Cincinnati, Akron, Toledo because I heard that they were using the programs and this is what their folks are saying, that kind of stuff.

Speaker 1 (44:49):

So it makes a difference to have the feedback from other districts in your state. And so do you want vendors to provide something that talks about the research that it's based on, or is that something, it sounded like it in that legwork?

Speaker 3 (45:07):

Yes and no because well, so yes and no. I like it when the vendors do provide it because it gives me a place to start. But vendors will, vendors are not going to give you the bad. They're only going to give you the good, right? So when they're showing their data and everything, they're going to come across and say, students who used our biology program showed a 30% increase in proficiency on state exams or whatever. But then I might then call Akron and they said, well, yeah, they did. But what they failed to tell you was we had to purchase additional materials in order to make the program work. They provided the core, but we didn't realize we were going to have to do this. Or they give you some of those insights maybe that the vendor's not going to necessarily tell you.

Speaker 1 (46:08):

So I've seen some vendors that have done big thick white papers, and I've seen some that have done a two page kind of summary of the research it. I've seen some that have just done it digitally. You,

Speaker 3 (46:21):

I want the two page digital,

Speaker 1 (46:24):

You want the two page digital. Okay,

Speaker 3 (46:27):

Alright. Right. If I need to, I can do the deeper dive, but usually I want something that I can access very quickly from my computer that is a relatively fast read before I make the decision to move on and do the deeper dive.

Speaker 1 (46:46):

Okay. Do school boards ever need to see those? Does it ever make it that far when something is being that's new,

Speaker 3 (46:56):

Right? So if it is a district adoption does go. So then what the steps are, I make the recommendation, purchasing checks, all the vending and all of that. It goes to our chief academic officer right now. She then relays it to our superintendent. He presents it to the board at the board thing saying that we want to adopt this program because they have to approve the final expenditure. So if we're spending over, it's over $5,000, we have to have board approval.

Speaker 1 (47:31):

Okay. Okay. Does the board turn things away? What are they looking for besides price? Are they looking

Speaker 3 (47:40):

Usually, I've never, other than price, I've never had the board turn anything that I've submitted through because as a general rule, they do trust the process. We, and this was a number of years ago, because we did not have a core curricular resource for K eight science, we were asked to my colleague, who is the K eight manager, we were asked to come to the board and do a presentation on the product that we were wanting to purchase at that time. Okay. This last go around, when we were doing the, it was really more of a renewal and just getting the most current version, it was more or less rubber stamped. We did not have to go through that because they were already familiar with what we had already adopted.

Speaker 1 (48:39):

Okay. That's interesting. We're right at 4 45. And do you have maybe some time to go? Maybe five more minutes. I want to be respectful of your time, but you've just got so many interesting things you do, and so I'm going to ask him to come in and see what questions she has. But one of my last ones too is are there any other people who are in similar roles to you that we should be talking to get maybe a different perspective or a different district or state or that kind of stuff?

Speaker 3 (49:21):

So my colleague Terry, she covers K eight science. We've both been in this position for about 10 years, but we overlap. So usually we speak for each other. So yes and no. If you're looking to get perspective in other content areas within Cleveland, I could connect you with our math content manager or social studies content manager. We're really looking for

Speaker 1 (49:49):

Science at the high school level, so it looks like we got the best one with you.

Speaker 3 (49:58):

Yeah. So if it's high school science, it's me.

Speaker 1 (50:00):

Okay.

Speaker 3 (50:01):

Good, bad or ugly. That's the way.

Speaker 1 (50:04):

Kim, do you have questions?

Speaker 2 (50:06):

I really don't. Again, this has been fantastic, but is there something that's popped to mind that Daily Lean usually ask us at the end? Is there Oh

Speaker 1 (50:18):

Yeah,

Speaker 2 (50:18):

I do. Go ahead. Or you asked that you articulate it well.

Speaker 1 (50:22):

What I usually say is this is your opportunity to talk directly to large science supply companies, solution companies, that kind of stuff. Is there something that you have just wanted that would make your life easier or teacher's life easier or make students learn better that you don't see that's out there?

Speaker 3 (50:46):

It goes back to that customer service piece, and right now, currently a lot of things are those AI chats or those robotic chats. People want to connect to a live human and usually pretty quickly when they run into trouble. So to be able to call the customer, help tech support and talk to somebody fairly quickly and to be able to jump on something like Zoom or teams where they can screen share to see what the problem is, I think that that's key. What I would like is cut me out as the middleman, because what often happens is the teacher contacts me with the issue, then I have to contact the vendor. I would like them to be able to directly feel comfortable enough connecting with the vendor so that that issue gets resolved. And instead of it taking 48 hours to up to a couple of weeks to make those connections because obviously then that is loss of learning for those students.

Speaker 1 (51:58):

Okay. What about from a product perspective or services around the product? Is there anything that you think is just missing out there that you wish were available?

Speaker 3 (52:13):

Well, I was going to say, sometimes for high school science kits, I not, they're usually one and dones like you use the kit and you cannot reuse the materials again in the kit. So more things where maybe you do a large scale purchase for the equipment piece of it. And then for the consumables, there is a way that you can set up a subscription like Amazon does, where you can say, oh, I want this delivered every two months or whatever. To be able to do that either. Because part of the problem is too, with consumables, particularly there's a lack of space and storage in the schools. So to be able to know that those materials are coming every couple of months or quarterly may be very, very helpful to a lot of the

Speaker 1 (53:17):

Schools. Okay, that's great. And Kim will wrap up with final thoughts. The other thing is, if in 10 minutes or two days you think, oh, I wish I would've said this, feel free to reach back out to us. Feel free to say, I forgot this and I really would love this. And honestly, if it's three months from now and you're like, Hey Daylene, who do you know that's doing such and such? Because I've had this brilliant idea that I think would be great for high school biology, feel free to do that as well. It's all about developing relationships for us and making sure that we have open dialogues and that we can make things better for you and for students.

Speaker 3 (54:06):

Yeah, do most level.

Speaker 1 (54:09):

Okay. Kim, do you have wrap up?

Speaker 2 (54:13):

Yes. Yes. So well, thank you for doing this. You're the first person at this level that we have talked to, and for me that was very enlightening, putting on a different hat or listening to your answers with a different hat on. So very much appreciated. Tomorrow you'll get an email from me. Thank you. But then also with contact information to be able to get ahold of us in the future, it'll also ask if you'd be interested in being involved in perhaps another interview session or survey at some point in time, depending on who our clients are or what's going on. So I hope you'll say yes,

Speaker 1 (55:02):

And you'll get your gift card. I'm going to send them out tomorrow doing the $95 as a Visa gift card. So if that's okay, that's what we're providing. And if in a day you're like, I haven't gotten it, check your spam folder. And if it's not your spam folder, call Kim.

Speaker 2 (55:26):

I'll be your customer service rep. I'll be the middleman

Speaker 3 (55:30):

Like every teacher. Woo-hoo. And Target, here I come.

Speaker 1 (55:33):

Yes, you've been fantastic and thank you so much for your dedication to science education and for everything that you do for students and teachers. We really appreciate it.

Speaker 3 (55:43):

Well, thank you. Thank you very much.

Speaker 1 (55:45):

Alright, we'll talk to you later.

Speaker 3 (55:47):

All right, bye-Bye. Kim,

Speaker 1 (55:52):

You want to hang back for just a second and I'm going to stop our recording.

Daylene Long (00:02):

I'm going to let Mike in and you're up. Hi Mike. Can you hear us? 

mike (00:41):

I can hear you. Can you hear me? We 

Daylene Long (00:47):

Can, yes. 

mike (00:49):

I don't know why. 

Daylene Long (00:56):

So there should be a video button that you can hit to start your video. 

mike (01:03):

Yep. The lights didn't come on and it didn't come on. It says it shows the little camera that it's on, so I got to, 

Kimberly Herder (01:15):

It might be, and this is one that my husband does all the time at the very top of, if you're on a laptop, it has where the camera is at to make sure that you slide that open. 

Daylene Long (01:28):

It's got a little slidey thing like this 

mike (01:33):

Right over the camera. Ah, wow. 

Kimberly Herder (01:39):

It is a tricky little thing. 

mike (01:43):

And Also, I know that was there. This is my second laptop or second Chromebook I've had for my school. The other one didn't have this on it. 

Kimberly Herder (01:52):

Oh. Oh. Well, that's what my husband had now, I think it's a week ago. He did a whole meeting that he was in charge of and really wrote up the IT department, not a nice note. And then to find out it was the little thing on the top that, 

Daylene Long (02:07):

Oh, he must Glad 

mike (02:09):

You knew that. 

Kimberly Herder (02:11):

So now he knows and I know too, so, well, Mike, very glad you're here with us. I'm Kim Herer, or with Daylene Long and she's a lead researcher. And yeah, this next 45 minutes is, we're going to probably go really fast. I am going to step off the camera in a moment and kind of do the background stuff. And while you and Daylene have a conversation, what am I forgetting that just, oh, take a minute to tell us about yourself too. Okay. What you're doing and what you've been doing and all those. Okay. Thank you. 

Daylene Long (02:58):

So tell us a little about yourself, Mike, what school are you at? States' it in just the basics. 

mike (03:06):

At Danville Community High School, I've technically retired from the classroom, but I'm now the planetarium director at Danville Community High School. We were built in 71 and we updated our system in 2019. So I work with a wide range. I just had kindergartners in last week, and boy, are they small? 

Daylene Long (03:34):

So I was the department head 

mike (03:38):

At Danville and I'm still connected. Well, I trained my department head. She's a former student of mine who is doing a fantastic job. And so 38 years of experience, mostly biology, but now just all astronomy, planetarium stuff. 

Daylene Long (04:02):

That's wonderful. Well, 

mike (04:04):

As 

Daylene Long (04:04):

Long as you can remember some of the last purchases you made from your school, we should be good for this interview. Let me give you a little background on it and make sure it still fits what you're doing. Oh, so first of all, we're recording and it's just for note taking purposes. I promise that you will not end up on YouTube and I won't ask you to do a TikTok dance or anything like that. It's just so I can take some notes. Let's see. The other thing is just kind of an overview of what we're doing too. We have a client who is really looking to improve wherever they can, life science education for teachers, for students. And so they want to kind of understand your whole buying process and what it looks like and why and how and what really excites you, what really frustrates you, and those types of things with the goal of improving the different things down the road. And at the end of the interview, we'll ask you to give some forward looking thoughts of are there things out there that you think that are missing that students need or that teachers need? And so kind of looking at it from that perspective, we ask a lot of what and why and who questions. And that's really just so we can kind of understand the whole landscape and the whole story behind it. 

mike (05:39):

No right or wrong 

Daylene Long (05:40):

Answers, and for some people it helps to think of Kim and I as filming a documentary because we're trying to get the whole story and we're trying to get a sense of what makes you happy when you're using science materials and what doesn't and all that other kind of thing. So any questions on that before we dive in? 

mike (06:06):

Nope. 

Daylene Long (06:07):

Okay. You mentioned in the survey that you took that you had purchased life science materials in the last six months. I want to make sure too with your current role, that that's still relevant and that there's enough of it that you can kind of remember some of the details. 

mike (06:26):

Yeah. Yeah. I was in the department head for 15 years, so I was responsible for all ordering for our, oh gosh. We had about $25,000 budget. That included chemistry and physics as well. But my life science with dissections, those kinds of materials, live materials, we took up a good chunk of that budget. 

Daylene Long (06:54):

You had 25,000 a year for your materials? 

mike (06:58):

We did. Now that's changed because the students don't no longer pay. There's no fees anymore. The state of Indiana took those away, so I don't know how much she currently has. I don't think he changed the budget for her at all. So there's still, yeah, by the time you get dissection materials, the students were charged a fee, so my anatomy students had a bigger fee. My college students had a bigger fee. 

Daylene Long (07:36):

You were a public high school? 

mike (07:39):

Yes. 

Daylene Long (07:41):

That's interesting. I have never heard of students at the public high school paying fees for labs before. So 

mike (07:50):

Yeah, we don't anymore. 

Daylene Long (07:52):

Yeah. And then you said you had some college students too, a two year, four year. What were you doing at that level? 

mike (08:01):

So I work for IU now doing teacher evaluations for the dual credit classes. So I taught, I used L 100 for 10, 11 years total. 

Daylene Long (08:13):

Oh, cool. What dual credit classes did they have at your school 

mike (08:25):

Besides the AP classes? We had an AP physics, which I don't consider dual credit. You got to get that test to four or five. Nothing happens. 

Daylene Long (08:37):

Yeah, 

mike (08:37):

So in the science department, we have a CP chemistry, which is a non-majors chemistry. They're getting ready to add the first major chemistry for the first semester of the majors course and the A CP biology, which is non-major bio. So the same gal that I trained is doing all those. That's Great. And then there's speech classes, there's speech, there's writing, there's, let's see, there's a Spanish, so those are all through iu. 

Daylene Long (09:18):

Okay. What's the name of the person that you trained? 

mike (09:23):

Heather Jackson. Trying 

Daylene Long (09:25):

To remember if I've talked to her or not. I don't think I've met her. Okay. So I want to have you kind of roll back in your memory a little bit to maybe the last year that you were the science department head and purchasing materials for life sciences. You've got years of experience on that. So how did that process go for you? When did you start deciding you were going to get for school year? How did you decide what you needed? Walk me through the process a little bit. 

mike (10:02):

So for me especially, it was important to make sure I taught the honors bio. So I had honors biology students and my goal for them is differentiate from regular bio and do more labs, making sure sometimes we would do a couple labs a week on materials and time, but we would have to have all of our money spent. So we'd get it in January and then have until the following year, and usually by the end of October, they want us to spend all the money by that point in time, so everything could be in at least have everything ordered, I guess by that time. So by the time December rolled around, they could close out the books for that year. So I always made sure I spent all the money and then I'd ask if anybody else had any money they hadn't spent in their departments typically. And I would dissection materials. Cats were really difficult to come by, dissect the cats from anatomy class for I don't know how many years. I did that a lot. That was 

Daylene Long (11:30):

My, 

mike (11:31):

I did rats for my college class. Everyone in my classes dissected something in some cases, multiple things. So that's a big expense. And finding the right company because they're not all created equal on those materials. 

Daylene Long (11:51):

Tell me a little bit more about that. What do you look for in terms of the companies that provide those materials? 

mike (12:03):

Well, I know prices is an important factor, and I'm going to guess it's going to be more important now without, because the state really didn't, the state changed the rules and give you Money. 

Daylene Long (12:24):

You're cutting out, 

mike (12:26):

Mike, you're cutting out just a little bit. We're having a hard Time, so that may impact that a little bit. But 

Daylene Long (12:33):

Mike, we okay? 

mike (12:34):

Yeah, we got 

Daylene Long (12:35):

You cutting out a little bit. I think I missed the last Minute. Okay. 

mike (12:38):

Maybe, I don't know. 

Daylene Long (12:40):

Got, 

mike (12:42):

Okay. Is it better yet? I can move to a different room if I need to. 

Daylene Long (12:46):

That's better. I think just leaning in towards the microphone. 

mike (12:51):

Okay. Yeah, I have a big nose and it gets really big in the window when I see it. You 

Daylene Long (12:56):

Do not have a big nose. I think you just have to get a little bit closer to the microphone. 

mike (13:08):

So my job, what I did, then I had to coordinate all, we had five of us in the department. I wasn't the only one that was spending the money. I tried to get them to, as they use something up, write it down for ordering supplies. If we needed something, we'd order it. If the money was there, it was easy to order. And I got together with Flynn and they gave us our school corporation, a 10% discount and free shipping. And we went up with the contract with them, and we spent most of our money there. They didn't have a couple of the specimens and some of the live stuff that I used, but once that happened and some of the other companies kind of switching a little bit, that was a big thing. Free shipping on some of those things. Free shipping on 50 pigs is quite a nice break. 

Daylene Long (14:15):

Yeah, 

mike (14:15):

We would do that. I just have a Question. I wouldn't do our big order in the spring. 

Daylene Long (14:22):

Okay. You'd do the big order in the spring, or you would not do the big order in the spring. 

mike (14:28):

So I like to have it come in during the summer so I'd have time to check everything in and get it distributed to the classrooms it belonged in. 

Daylene Long (14:38):

You were working in the summer to take those deliveries 

mike (14:44):

Teachers, as my principal would say, your salary, you're not hourly. You can come in whenever, but yeah, I would go in and do it. 

Daylene Long (14:55):

Okay. I have a question about Flynn. So you mentioned that they gave you a 10% discount. Did that come negotiated through the district or through your school? 

mike (15:13):

I just set it up, I don't even know. It's been a few years now. We've used it for a while. I don't remember even what I got in contact with the representative now. Either my principal or purchasing person signed off on it, but I got it set up and they have said, yeah, sure. 

Daylene Long (15:37):

Okay. Well that's pretty good. So you liked the free shipping, you liked the discount. Did Flynn offer you any other kind of perks around that that were important to you? 

mike (15:52):

No, that was it. Tell they were pretty good at getting things out too. So if we needed something quickly, we could pay extra, get it shipped, but their website was good, I could get on there and find things pretty easily and then I could just put in a PO number, actually made up number. My treasure just had me put the date and my name and everything worked out really well at doing that. 

Daylene Long (16:31):

So you mentioned that you usually could get the materials pretty well on time, but that if you needed 'em faster, you could pay extra for shipping. So there were limitations then on what the free shipping were like. Did they say everything within two weeks or did they limit and say those big boxes of fetal pigs, we will discount those or were there other kind of limitations? The 

mike (17:01):

Only other limitations when there were special, like hydrochloric acid, had to have special shipping. Those were always, we had to pay the shipping on those. 

Daylene Long (17:13):

So there was a clause that maybe had some other things that were limited in there. Yeah. Okay. And then so do you remember what you bought from Flint? Which were the key specimens that you've bought? 

mike (17:38):

All my cats got my dissecting equipment it through a representative. I got some used microscopes. Let's see. Yeah, 

Daylene Long (17:53):

You mentioned the fetal pigs. Did Those, the rats? Yeah. 

mike (17:58):

Yeah. Yeah. 

Daylene Long (17:59):

Okay. Rats. I got double. 

mike (18:02):

Yeah, they didn't have, I did live frogs. I had to go through Carolina to get the live frogs to use and 

Daylene Long (18:15):

Every 

mike (18:15):

Once in a while I would get some other live materials and usually Carolina would be who I went through for my live stuff. 

Daylene Long (18:25):

Okay. What did you like about Carolina for the live stuff? 

mike (18:32):

Well, they had it so there was more than one time where they screwed up the dates of stuff. And this last, so I had frog come in at the wrong time and you can't ship them back. So I just scrambled and did, I mean, it was like, okay, we're not ready for these, but we're going to do 'em anyway. You 

Daylene Long (19:06):

Said 

mike (19:07):

The last 

Daylene Long (19:08):

Couple years, 

mike (19:11):

Go ahead. Last couple years it's been hard to get any decent sized ones because of weather. And I mean, that was supplier problem. That was a nature thing that was nothing to do with what they had control over. But for the most part, I was pretty happy with the frog specimens. I did some plant specimens that we got from them. They were shipped, they were well taken care of. I didn't have any death in shipment or anything, so it was pretty well done. 

Daylene Long (19:46):

You mentioned that the frog thing happened a couple of times where you'd get them at the wrong time. Was that any time in the last 2, 3, 5 years? Was it a while ago? Do you remember 

mike (20:05):

The early, when it shipped early? It was probably, oh gosh, I'm trying to think back what other teachers were in my department with me. That gives me a timeframe. It was Jim. Yeah, it's probably been probably seven, 

Daylene Long (20:26):

Seven Years. 

mike (20:27):

Seven years on the early arrival. And they just shipped them with everything else 

Daylene Long (20:34):

Instead of shipping them on the daily requested. 

mike (20:37):

And then I had a couple, couple that were delayed, which is always better. Then getting 'em early. We were ready for 'em when they came in. One of the delays was two years ago. It took an extra month beyond what they said now they didn't communicate very well on it, and it was like, okay. But yeah, overall pretty good. Have 

Daylene Long (21:14):

They changed the way that they've done their shipping of the live animals over the years? Not really. The frogs are always in a box and with moisture with holes and they had to come. 

mike (21:29):

You could only get 'em arriving certain days because of how they had to ship. I think they do two day shipment, I think, if I'm not mistaken. 

Daylene Long (21:39):

Okay. That's helpful. Let's see. I'm going to flip through my notes. Any other kinds of life science materials that you routinely purchased? 

mike (21:56):

So different slides I had with my anatomy class, getting some tissue samples, and Flynn had all the tissues I needed for human anatomy. They're expensive, but for me, knowing that they were going to use that when they went to college was important to have on hand and having more than one of each type of tissue. So you've got 25 students in trying to use the slides, you have to. So I would, a lot of times at the end when we were, if the others didn't have any requests on Monday to be spent and I had some leftover, I'd just get a couple of tissue slides. It's like, okay, I have a hundred bucks left. I can get, geez, they're probably five to 10 bucks each, depending on if they were human or others mammalian of some type. 

Daylene Long (22:59):

Interesting. Okay. Let's see. I had something in there. So what about anything with technology? It sounds like you were a pretty hands-on guy. Did you do anything with other things that you'd buy from Flinto Carolina, whether it's balances or beakers or probes or digital labs, any of those kinds of things? 

mike (23:31):

Yeah, we didn't have gas in our room, so hot plates and they get broken and go bad. So that was another one of those things. So technically that was a equipment thing. So we had two separate funds. One was for equipment, one was for consumer, 

Daylene Long (23:55):

And they were separate budgets. That was the one was the one that came from the students. 

mike (24:03):

But my gal was pretty good at finagling things, so hot plates weren't cheap and those, I don't know if I got all mine through Flint or not. I know there were a couple times before I got the 10% discount. It was like, okay, I'm just going to find the best price and get hot plates a hot plate. And I used those several times. So we would get one of those things is like, okay, there's money leftover. We have enough or a hot plate. Let's get a hot plate, have it on hand for when one other one goes out. Electronic balances were kind of expensive. And another one of those things that when you get 10% off, that goes well. We had, they were Vernier calipers. So the technology wise we've had that has been added. Chemistry started using 'em first and then but dissolved oxygen to do some sampling, some water testing at pH we use as well. And 

Daylene Long (25:30):

You bought all those through Flint? 

mike (25:33):

No, that was Werner. I think all that Probeware went. Heather took care of that. She got a grant to get some of that. 

Daylene Long (25:47):

Okay. So that came out of a different budget allocation in terms of some of the technology that you were buying? 

mike (25:54):

Yeah. Yeah. 

Daylene Long (25:56):

Remind me again, you said you had about 10,000 for consumables. What was your technology budget around, do you remember? 

mike (26:06):

No, because the tech, straight up tech all came through the corporation. We didn't have a lot of choices on some of the stuff I did use, I can't remember the company, we got it from a couple of cameras that go on top of the microscope and you can plug 'em right into your computer. I got two of those. We had a kid that was visually impaired and the microscope was not going to be something that he was going to be able to look directly into. So both the classrooms he was in, I had a little camera that he could use and still be able to participate. It's a 

Daylene Long (26:55):

Nice accommodation and I think it's really neat technology too for the scopes. I'm just going to flip through my notes here and see if I missed anything on that part. Do your teachers keep any kind of, or did they keep any kind of a running wishlist or Excel spreadsheet or did vendors send you their pos from last year or your POS from last year? How did you assess what you bought in the past and what you needed? 

mike (27:36):

Well, Heather was really good because she had the chemical storeroom, which that's a big pain in the rear. And the chemicals we use in biology, the sugars and those kind of things. I just kept a running inventory and I would go through, would just go through my labs that I do and check off to make sure I had those supplies on hand. I was taught by one of the best to hoard everything as a teacher, including tape and lock it up because people will come and take it. So my room on I left was well stocked glassware wise. That's another one of those. It's considered a consumable instead of equipment because so much of it is lost. So I would always get glassware and essentially by inventory looking. And then when she ran out of something or was getting low in the chemical department, she just had a list on the wall that she kept. And a couple of my guys, I think they got shorted a couple times. They didn't have any. It's like, well, we don't know what to order. They were kind of new and it's like, well, I'll have enough on hand of the things I know that I do. If you want to do those things, then I've got it. 

Daylene Long (29:17):

Yeah. Okay. So you've mentioned Flynn and Carolina and Vernier. Are there any other vendors that were kind of your go-to suppliers 

mike (29:31):

Somewhere? I've got a red thing like this from science kit. 

Daylene Long (29:37):

Science kit. Okay. 

mike (29:41):

That got merged into something, right? I 

Daylene Long (29:44):

Think you might be right. I don't remember exactly who they might've merged 

mike (29:47):

Into though Every order for a few years and I was using them predominantly. And when we got connected with Flynn through the guy who does the microscopes and then we got the discount, it's like, okay, I'll go with them. But I've got a couple of red shirts that have their science kit stuff on it, but it's been a while since I had done anything through anyone else. There was a biology, it was a dissecting company, Corp I think is the name of it. 

Daylene Long (30:34):

Yeah, I heard that. 

mike (30:36):

And their specimens were just 

Daylene Long (30:40):

Terrible. 

mike (30:41):

I used them one time and I'm going like, no, that won't happen again. 

Daylene Long (30:46):

What was wrong with them? 

mike (30:48):

The quality wise, the injection wise, because I always got injected once the cardiovascular system with whatever we're dissecting and they didn't look good just overall tissue wise. I don't know what preservative they were using. And it was cheaper, but I didn't get the shipping was whew, man. That was only one time I used them. 

Daylene Long (31:25):

Okay. Science kits I'm assuming, and I don't remember that they sold science kits. Is that, did you buy science kits for biology? Either through them or through flan or Carolina? Did you buy the Preki stuff? 

mike (31:49):

Not really. The only kits I got were through Bio-Rad, 

Daylene Long (31:53):

Bio-Rad. Okay. Okay. You Bring that up. The 

mike (31:59):

Technology, BioRad Micro Pipettes Genetics Transformation Lab. Oh, that's a really good lab. The 

Daylene Long (32:06):

Transformation Lab is okay. And I noticed you're still wearing, you're very nice. It looks like it's almost like a fleece kind of thing from Science Kit. They must have liked you. 

mike (32:21):

It's Christmas. It's Christmas. I've got it hanging up right behind me. Huh. 

Daylene Long (32:28):

Very nice. Okay. Are there any other companies that give good swag? I always like to keep a list of those. 

mike (32:41):

I think it was science kit also that would give us free lab coats as well. 

Daylene Long (32:47):

Oh, that's nice. 

mike (32:48):

Every year we got lab coats with our orders. So my room, I didn't bring any home, so I left hanging in my room like 10 lab coats. 

Daylene Long (33:02):

But free shipping Trumps lab coats. Right. 

mike (33:07):

Yeah, it's nice. It doesn't take much to get to, honestly. It doesn't take much to make teachers happy. I talk to people who are planning workshops. I say, just feed us. Give us an hour for lunch. Let us talk to each other and you'll have a great workshop. 

Daylene Long (33:30):

That's really good advice. It is. Any other advice you would have on making teachers happy? 

mike (33:37):

Oh gosh. Not that you tell all the administrators more meetings is not the answer. And more state testing is not the answer. But that's not in your control. 

Daylene Long (33:53):

No, but I'm with you there. More meetings is definitely not the answer. Of all the different kinds of vendors that you've talked about, are any of 'em ones that you would say you were loyal to? I'd 

mike (34:14):

Say when, shoot, let's go goes back a little while. They used to have representatives come to our building and actually talk to us. And besides on the phone and through email, I haven't done that. I haven't had a personal connection and I don't know that that's as important with the younger people coming through or not. But I always found that to be, well there is one. So the guy who represented Flynn also cleaned our microscopes. He cleaned and He's the one that said, Hey, all you got to do is ask. They'll give you, yeah. Yeah. So he was a Flint representative for years and then he got into cleaning and repairing microscopes so he would come and pick 'em up. I think last time I had 'em done before I retired. Before he retired, he had been doing it forever. And I don't know if you can find anybody to reset and clean microscopes at this point out There. I dunno either. Sounds 

Daylene Long (35:38):

Like you lost that when he retired. 

mike (35:42):

Well, I retired too, so I don't have to worry about it. You can go. 

Daylene Long (35:48):

Okay. Anybody else that you can think of? So it sounds like the personal relationship was important to you in terms of loyalty. Any other companies you can think of that you would consider yourself to be loyal to or any other reasons you would consider yourself to be loyal? Not 

mike (36:08):

In the biological world. I've got my company who sold me our equipment for the planetarium. Well, I kind of have to go back there. Nobody else can service or add to my planetarium. And that was the guy who showed up and demonstrated it to me that that was the reason we went with his company. 

Daylene Long (36:40):

He showed up and demoed it and now you're kind of locked in with them because different components you need to get from them. 

mike (36:50):

Yep. 

Daylene Long (36:51):

Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. Did your school have an account with Amazon, like a business account with Amazon? Yeah. 

mike (37:02):

Matter of fact, I just got, let's see, I just got two things from Amazon for the planetarium just in the last two weeks I got a grant and Amazon's just easy to go through and we have an actual school account with Amazon. When 

Daylene Long (37:26):

Did you get a school account with them? I'm trying to figure out when Amazon started going to schools. 

mike (37:34):

I think it's either last year or the last two years, but not before that. 

Daylene Long (37:42):

Okay. That's pretty consistent with what I'm hearing from other people too. Let me just flip through. Are there any conferences or social media accounts or anything like that where you connect with other teachers or hear about new products and services? 

mike (38:10):

Yeah, well not been to a national convention, but here they're really good National Association of Biology teachers for our state biology teachers association. I was an officer for three years and we do, so we have a Hoosier of science teachers and they have, in February we have our, it's a couple day conference. I presented four or five times at that. And then we have within that are the individuals. So the chemistry teachers have their own little thing during that time. It's not big enough to have just the chemistry or bio or astronomy. Definitely. We're a small group and that happens every year. And then honestly our school keeps trying to force PLCs on everybody and I was the only one that taught all my classes. Well, I found Facebook groups were my best. I mean if I needed something. And in my last, well last couple years of human anatomy, I was still finding new things to do an ad because of that group. 

Daylene Long (39:47):

And was the group through NABT or was it a different one? 

mike (39:54):

No, that one's a group. The human anatomy teachers, it's a Facebook group, so it's international. You got people all over the world contributing and going, oh, I have this idea. Yeah, 

Daylene Long (40:12):

That's really cool. Lemme see. Really the last question I've got for you and then I will bring Kim in and see if she's got any questions is kind of from a bigger picture perspective. So thinking about what kids need or what teachers need that doesn't exist that you wished some company would provide, do you have any feedback, and this is really your opportunity to talk directly to product developers who can make those things happen? 

mike (40:55):

Man, that's a good question. I see so much. I've got, I don't know how many people in the world have them, but Lego did Allego DNA that you would put together individual nucleotides and they were magnetic so you could take 'em apart and replicate, you can take 'em apart and transcribe and I don't know how many that was another grant and that's been a while when I had those things like that. The hands-on things. And there are companies out there that have 'em. I know I did. There's, it's kind of a foam model and you do a protein synthesis thing going on. I tell you what the stuff that HHMI has as far as teaching that is just right there. And if you're a struggling science, especially life science teacher, they just need to go there and start using those because you need guidance. But they're really good. 

Daylene Long (42:19):

Those meaning like their videos or what Were the, oh, their whole package 

mike (42:24):

They've got, so they've got the videos and it may be a video with the quiz embedded in it. The other thing I wish they would do is they would have a light version of the papers that went around because when you print those out, they're like, you can get a 10 or 11 page document that's just more depth than you really need and have time for. And I would just modify 'em and take parts out. 

Daylene Long (42:51):

Having an abstract maybe and then the rest of it or something like that or a one page abstract. Yeah. 

mike (42:58):

Yeah, that makes a lot 

Daylene Long (42:58):

Of sense. Anything else that you can think of before we check in with Kim him? 

mike (43:07):

No, I think I can't get a cadaver for my high school. So we used to take field trips down to IU and go to the human cadaver lab and the big football player would usually either pass out or puke and it was always fun, but you don't get the hands on. We couldn't touch it. But seeing human dissected was, I think all those students will talk about their experience doing that. That's kind of hard to do those anymore. I think. 

Daylene Long (43:48):

I'll tell you, having done that myself in college, both from the perspective of really understanding that we look different on the inside according to age and disease and how your cells divide to just really having a deep appreciation for the people who did donate their bodies to be studied. It is a very profound experience I think that you get to have. So I'm glad that when you could that you provided that for your students. For me that was life-changing. It really was. Kimberly, you have any questions for Mike? 

Kimberly Herder (44:35):

Well I did, but you kind of touched on it a little bit just a minute ago was on videos or the use of YouTube or something like that, if that was present in your class, if kids responded to it, what you think about it and what you handed down to your next teacher that sort of, where did that play a part in your game plan? 

mike (45:05):

So my last year I was in a fellowship through iu, gosh, I'm blanking on the name of the process, but my goal was to get my students better at taking notes and I had all freshmen that year and going through that process, getting them to understand that they're going to learn a little different and here are the videos. Some people have flipped classrooms. I never went in for the flipped classroom, but if they couldn't get it from what we talked about in class in the lab, then there were a couple really good series out there were they MABA sisters? Sisters. So if you were a guppy in the world of biology, the amoeba sisters are where you should go. And then crash course did a nice set of things. I think actually crash course I think is now part of and paired with I think HHE. 

Daylene Long (46:28):

They are, 

mike (46:34):

I'm still in a Facebook group, so I see things go across. One thing that makes me sad, I saw a post and I commented on, it's like is dissection worth it? And I'm going like, yes, it is worth it. And it was like, oh, I don't think my kids get a lot out of it. I'm going, because you're not doing your job. You got to go around and you got to keep in there with the kids and you got to show them and ask them questions and keep them engaged. 

Daylene Long (47:06):

It 

mike (47:06):

Just frustrates me what some people think teaching is this. 

Daylene Long (47:12):

Kim and I both have run across both districts and whole states that don't do dissection anymore. And I'm not even sure what to think about. It was, I don't know. I don't want to be judgmental, but it is interesting that there are I'll, 

mike (47:35):

They need to do it. 

Daylene Long (47:37):

Do it. 

mike (47:39):

If you want me, I can go teach all the teachers how to teach dissections. Students will be engaged and you don't say, oh, if you don't want to do it. My students, I had maybe I dissected a lot and I had maybe five that ever opted out and I didn't say anything. I didn't say you had to do it. They didn't ask. 

Daylene Long (48:12):

Yeah. Well you know what, Mike, it sounds like you have a lot still to give back to the education community. So I hope in your retirement you both get some time to just relax and enjoy life. But I have a feeling you're going to stay connected. 

mike (48:34):

I retired from Nabo, I'm back there and I also do a career coaching for the IEP kids. I'm working, doing that one day a week. So the guy I did FCA with said the other, he goes, I've seen you more this year than I did the end of last year when I was using up all my sick days. I said, 

Kimberly Herder (48:54):

Well, 

mike (48:56):

I'm get paid by the hour now. So when you see me now I'm getting paid. Period. 

Kimberly Herder (49:03):

Good 

Daylene Long (49:04):

Thing. Kim, any last questions from you? And if not, do you want to walk Mike through what happens next? 

Kimberly Herder (49:11):

Yes. Yes. So no, I don't have any more questions, but I do have a huge thank you and thank you for both everything you've done and thank you for participating in this with us. And then this afternoon or later today, you'll get an email from me that is a thank you. And in there are two questions. One, if you think of anything later today over the weekend, the next week or so, please just reach out, follow up and inform us. And the second one is that if you would be interested in participating in something like this. Again, we work with a lot of different clients who ask a lot of different questions and that sort of thing. And would love to have your input on those things as well. 

mike (50:09):

Okay. 

Daylene Long (50:11):

And then you'll get probably in about an hour, you'll get the gift card from me and you'll have a choice of a Visa gift card or a Target gift card. I think there's a couple of other options in there as well. But you should get that today. 

mike (50:31):

Okay. 

Daylene Long (50:32):

And like Kim said, if you've got any other thoughts or follow up questions, just let us know. 

mike (50:39):

I have lots of thoughts. I have lots of thoughts. You should be teaching it this way for crying out loud. 

Daylene Long (50:47):

Got it. All right, well thank you so much and thank you for all that you have done for your students over the years and thank you for all that you do for teachers. We really appreciate it. Well, 

mike (50:59):

Thank you. Bye-Bye. Good.

Speaker 1 (00:08):

I'm going to take some late breakfast bites while Vanessa, it's been a crazy week.

Speaker 2 (00:17):

It's Friday

Speaker 1 (00:19):

Next week. Looks crazy too. I know it's, it's all good.

Speaker 2 (00:31):

Hello? Oh,

Speaker 3 (00:33):

I have a little laryngitis myself too, so that may not help with audio.

Speaker 1 (00:39):

Well, we'll just kind of see how it goes and if we have to clarify anything afterwards, we are recording it just for our notes. You won't end up on YouTube and I'm not going to ask you to do a TikTok dance or anything like that, but we may need to follow up then since you do have a little bit of laryngitis on that. And we'll try and make it so it doesn't strain your voice too much. I'm so sorry. It's horrible when that happens and you're

Speaker 3 (01:11):

Just lingering. I already feel better, but the voice is

Speaker 1 (01:16):

Slow

Speaker 3 (01:16):

To catch up.

Speaker 1 (01:18):

Let me pull up my notes. Kim, do you want to do introductions while I pull up my notes for Vanessa?

Speaker 2 (01:24):

Sure. I'm Kim Herder and that's daily long and she's our lead researcher and I'm glad you're here with us today. So this is 45 minutes. That's going to go really quickly that we're going to ask you things about both your teaching style and how you buy things and just want to hear your honest opinions. Okay, great. Okay. And I'm going to step off camera and all, but I'll be here for technical difficulty and then pop back in if there's something else that's needed.

Speaker 3 (02:00):

Okay, sounds good.

Speaker 1 (02:02):

All right. So I'm going to pull up my notes here and just kind of start in. So just tell me a little bit more about yourself, Vanessa, I didn't have a chance to look at your profile before I came on. Are you at the building level or are you at the district level?

Speaker 3 (02:20):

I'm a classroom teacher.

Speaker 1 (02:22):

You're a classroom teacher. And what do you teach?

Speaker 3 (02:24):

Science. I teach biology and ap, environmental science,

Speaker 1 (02:29):

Biology and AP Environmental science. Okay. Yes, correct. That sounds good. And let me just go through some of the fundamentals with you while my notes try to load.

Speaker 1 (02:44):

We mentioned the recording and then our goal today really is to understand the kind of materials that you buy for bio, for AP bio for AP Environmental. But we're interested in the process, so we'll have you start back at the beginning and just, we need to better understand how it works. And really the goal on this is that we have a client who wants to know how to make it better for educators are the things that they can provide that would make it better for your teaching or make it better for students. And so that's really our goal today. Let's see. You're going to see that I ask a lot of what and why questions. I might go out back and say, five minutes ago you said this and then ask you to clarify something.

Speaker 3 (03:37):

Okay.

Speaker 1 (03:39):

No right or wrong answers. And it's helpful for people to think of Kim and I as filming like a documentary. We'll talk about parts of the process that you're like, why do they need to know that? But we're looking for two to your frustration points, the points where something has given you joy or that has given your students joy. And then at the very end we'll ask you some questions about what you wish existed. So that's kind of the framework work. And then I know that in your survey you mentioned that you had purchased life science materials in the last six months or so.

Speaker 3 (04:21):

Yes, that's correct.

Speaker 1 (04:22):

Tell me a little bit about that and how you decided what you needed. I

Speaker 3 (04:30):

Base it off of the AP curriculum or the state curriculum and look for materials that can help me to teach different areas of the curriculum through living organisms. So for example, we do a lot with composting and AP environmental science. I use the compost bins not only to teach about alternatives to waste disposal, but also to show the students the nutrient density in composted soil versus soil that we dig up outside.

Speaker 1 (05:02):

Oh, that's

Speaker 3 (05:03):

Cool. Live red worms. In order to maintain my compost bins, currently my students have aquatic e I'm looking around my room currently. My students have aquatic ecosystem set up and they're testing for nutrient cycling. So your nitrogen, your phosphorus, your sulfur compounds, and how the different organisms contribute to those. And so they monitor the levels week by week. I use aloia in biology so the students can observe plant cells under the microscope. So those are some of the ways that we use live items.

Speaker 1 (05:41):

So besides the fact that it's part of the standards, I bet I'm guessing that your students are really interested in the topics that you're teaching. It sounds like you're connecting to a lot of their

Speaker 3 (05:57):

Well, I think the live items help them to connect. It's real, it's tangible. It's not just a preserved specimen or a slide that's been prepared. So they feel like they're more connected to the material and I think it helps them remember the content better.

Speaker 1 (06:13):

That's interesting. Okay. So what did you buy in the last six months and can you tell me how you do it? If you take an inventory to see what you want to do or how does that, what's the very first spark that says, okay, we need to get some materials?

Speaker 3 (06:34):

Well, we use a consortium. So we are given a budget for each science teacher and we are allowed to order items and then they go out to bid for them. So I plan what I want to buy with my budget based off of either past experience labs that I know are successful or things that I'm like, this is really boring or this is lacking. Let me see how I can kind of beef it up and I'll look for materials that way. And so for us, when we're in the website that we use, it pulls from several different catalogs. So I will search for whatever topic I'm looking for if I'm looking for a specific item, and then it'll show me where it appears in several different catalogs and I can look at, are there prepackaged kits, am I going to piece it together on my own? And that's sort of my process.

Speaker 1 (07:39):

What's the name of the consortium?

Speaker 3 (07:41):

It's called Ed Data.

Speaker 1 (07:43):

Ed Data. And remind me what district and state you're in

Speaker 3 (07:49):

New Jersey and it's Morris Hills Regional District.

Speaker 1 (07:57):

So the ED data pulls from the different catalogs for what you might want. And so give me an idea with the elodia or with the red worms or the soil, where did you purchase those products? Does ED data tell you where they're drawing it from?

Speaker 3 (08:20):

I can put where I prefer to get it from.

Speaker 1 (08:23):

Okay.

Speaker 3 (08:24):

So it'll tell me, okay, Flynn has red worms, Carolina has red worms and another company, three different good nasco or something like that. And then I'll go, well, I've had a really good experience with Carolina, so I'm going to use Carolina's red worms because theirs are higher quality or whatever. Or sometimes I'll say, well, I can get more because cheaper here. So it depends. Sometimes I have a little to draw on to say, well, I like the quality from this company versus that. And then if they can't fulfill that bid or if something goes wrong, then I have the opportunity to say, okay, I'll take it from somewhere else.

Speaker 1 (09:03):

Okay. So you said you had a really good experience with Carolina. What did you like about them?

Speaker 3 (09:12):

Their customer services really great. They also send me all of the forms so that I have, it's already been purchased and I can go in and say, okay, I want them on this date. That all goes through me instead of going through the district level. So I have some control. Alright, I want those red worms on Wednesday. I don't want them on a Friday at two 30. Nobody's going to touch them till Monday morning. Things like that. So I get a lot of that control put into my hands as opposed to leaving it to someone else.

Speaker 1 (09:46):

That sounds good. And then you mentioned also Flynn and Nasco. Are there things about them that you,

Speaker 3 (09:57):

Depends on what I'm purchasing, but yeah, there have been kits and items where I'm like, oh no, they're my go-to For that particular kit or that particular item

Speaker 1 (10:08):

With Flynn, can you think of anything that you typically would buy from them?

Speaker 3 (10:15):

There's a diffusion lab kit I've purchased from them a couple of times. They also have a really good cell respiration kit that I've used from them for biology. They have a lot of those really quick labs that I can do in a short amount of time where I don't have to use an entire period or block to do that in, but I can reinforce the material quickly. So I like some of their stuff for that.

Speaker 1 (10:41):

The quick labs are interesting. So are they quick based on student time, based on lab prep? What makes them quick?

Speaker 3 (10:51):

Both. They're easy to prep and they don't take a lot of time. They condense it so that the students can get everything that they need out of the experiment or out of the lab in 20, 30, 40 minutes instead of a full 90 minutes or even multiple days.

Speaker 1 (11:08):

Okay. So for you, it sounds like then a quick lab is 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 40 minutes, something in there and

Speaker 3 (11:14):

Yeah, 40 is a little bit on the longer end, but yeah, I would say 30 and under is a good quick way for me to reinforce something.

Speaker 1 (11:21):

And you've got 90 minute blocks. Okay. Correct. Just generally, I know it changes from year to year, but what is the budget that you get per teacher where you

Speaker 3 (11:35):

Are? I want to say it's 15 ish.

Speaker 1 (11:39):

1500 minus?

Speaker 3 (11:40):

Yeah. Okay. Around 1500 per teacher, which is really what I've heard from other districts. Pretty great. We're pretty fortunate here.

Speaker 1 (11:48):

Yeah, it is.

Speaker 3 (11:50):

And basically we are allowed to order whatever need within that 1500. As long as you don't go over, we're kind of given the freedom that whatever's in there is fair game. So it gives us a lot of autonomy.

Speaker 1 (12:04):

Okay. Do you buy all year long or do you have certain times of the year that you typically buy?

Speaker 3 (12:10):

Usually we buy at one time of the year, but then I get a lot of those coupons where I can redeem them so my live items will come when I need them. Anything that can is shelf stable, then it'll come over the summer to be prepared for September.

Speaker 1 (12:25):

Okay. When do you actually place your order?

Speaker 3 (12:28):

I want to say it's like end of March is when our portion is due.

Speaker 1 (12:34):

Okay. That's helpful to know. Do you ever get a teacher or not a teacher, like a principal or a district person that says, Hey, Vanessa, we've got an extra, I dunno, 2000 or 5,000 or whatever, and then tell me a little bit about how that process works?

Speaker 3 (12:52):

Yes. That's happened to me before. That's like Christmas day, so my supervisor has said, I've got this little extra cash, what do you want? And then I will really go for my big ticket items that usually eat up a big portion of my budget that I can't really budget for every year. Scales, probes, more of that big item equipment that costs a good,

Speaker 1 (13:22):

Those go through the consortium too?

Speaker 3 (13:25):

I don't think so. I'm not a hundred percent sure on that, but I don't believe so. I believe we give our secretary the item numbers that we want and she directly orders them through those catalogs.

Speaker 1 (13:37):

Okay. So you have a choice of vendors on those too, you'll say? Yes. Okay.

Speaker 3 (13:44):

Yeah, that's another really great thing about that kind of situation is that I'm pretty sure we don't go through that consortium because I can say, well, I know I get the best probes here. This is what I want. I don't want any substitution and we get what we ask for.

Speaker 1 (14:02):

Where do you typically get your probes from?

Speaker 3 (14:05):

Carolina.

Speaker 1 (14:06):

You do? Okay, good. Yeah,

Speaker 3 (14:08):

Sergeant Welsh too. I've used Sergeant Welsh.

Speaker 1 (14:10):

Okay. And then where do you get your balances from?

Speaker 3 (14:19):

There's a particular brand that I like and I can't think of the name off my head, but I think I've gotten them from a couple of different places depending on price. I'll price them out and I could go look at them if you want, but there's a brand I like, but several different companies carry the brand.

Speaker 1 (14:39):

Okay. And then so do any of the vendors you work with wrap up any kind of professional development, whether it is in-person, asynchronous videos, really good resources online? Tell me a little bit about the supports you get that way.

Speaker 3 (15:01):

They have definitely been packaged with internet resources, which could include just some instructions, could include videos on how to use it. Even sometimes some of the Carolina things come with, here are some examples of labs you can do with this equipment, all web-based, which is helpful.

Speaker 1 (15:27):

And so what if those resources is most helpful to you in the way that you learn?

Speaker 3 (15:33):

I like a website where I can go on and access at my leisure, take what I need, leave behind what isn't necessary. If I've used it for a while, I don't need training on how it's used, but I might want some good ideas on how I might use it.

Speaker 1 (15:50):

So you're on the website and you're looking for maybe ideas on how to use something. How do you find those new ideas?

Speaker 3 (16:01):

Sometimes they're on a card and it'll say CR website for a great lab on how to measure dissolved oxygen, let's say. And so then that'll lead me to go and check it out. Other times I'm just perusing through setup and then I'll see it there. So it depends on how it comes packaged. A lot of times it's in the packaging.

Speaker 1 (16:24):

So you don't go to the website then and type in the search bar like a standard or a topic or an experiment?

Speaker 3 (16:31):

Not typically, no.

Speaker 1 (16:33):

Okay.

Speaker 3 (16:34):

Now, a lot of times when I'm purchasing, it's because I have something in mind. I need to be able to do X, and then if I can use it in other ways, that's great, but I usually have a particular need.

Speaker 1 (16:51):

And does the X correspond to a learning topic or what is it usually? What's usually

Speaker 3 (17:00):

A learning topic or a way in which I can enhance something I'm already doing like a probe. We can measure dissolved oxygen, but it's tedious. It's not as easy for the students. They don't get great data where a probe, which is expensive, but it gives me great accurate data quickly. My students see what's happening more in real time. Yeah.

Speaker 1 (17:24):

Do you buy a probe per lab team or how do you determine how many you

Speaker 3 (17:30):

Need? So I'm the only one here who teaches AP environmental science, so some things I just purchased because I feel like I need them and I'll have one, then I can afford a second one, and then my hope is that I'll get enough for every lab group. Last year we got a grant from new for climate change, and then we purchased as a team. All of the teachers were involved in picking out the resources we wanted, and we planned a field trip based on that, and so we were like, okay, well, we need probes, we need this, we need that. That was one of those opportunities where we had a good deal of money to spend and got what we wanted.

Speaker 1 (18:09):

Good. That sounds wonderful. Let's see. I'm looking through my notes back to the videos for a minute. Are there any that you wish you had for students?

Speaker 3 (18:27):

Yeah, that would be a lot of times just them instead of me having to demo how to use something or how to interpret their results, that would be helpful that they could do that on their own.

Speaker 1 (18:43):

That's okay. And maybe to prep for the lab or would it be afterwards or to make up for a lab or I

Speaker 3 (18:50):

Would say before for how to use, but how to interpret after would be great.

Speaker 1 (18:57):

Okay. All right. That's interesting. Let's see. Are there any vendors that you consider yourself to be loyal to?

Speaker 3 (19:11):

I purchased probably the largest majority from Carolina.

Speaker 1 (19:16):

Okay. And you mentioned a few different reasons that you liked Carolina. Are there any more that you can think of? You talked about customer service, you talked about the quality of the live materials, but you also bought the probes, and so you bought some technology and LabWare kind of stuff from

Speaker 3 (19:33):

Yeah. Yeah. Their customer services is great. I had a probe once that wasn't working. I called them. They replaced it for me right away. Yeah, like I said, the ability to control some of when they're delivered is helpful.

Speaker 1 (19:57):

Yeah, it gives you some control over the quality, right? I mean, yeah. Let's see. Are there, with any of the vendors that you've used, have there been any frustration points that you're like, oh, that just doesn't work for teachers or that doesn't work for students?

Speaker 3 (20:22):

How do you mean? The use of the materials?

Speaker 1 (20:27):

In the use of the materials where you wish you had something different because whatever's being provided to you is not what you were expecting or it caused frustration

Speaker 3 (20:38):

With the kits? I would say that happens. I find that I get, once I've used the kit, a lot of times I'll then piecemeal it together myself. For example, I have a kit that you need test strips for, and they'll mail you the kit and the test strips are almost or already expired, where if I order them separately, I can guarantee some of the quality control versus what comes prepackaged. So while I like having it all in one box, and it's a good starting point for me to know how to run the lab, what materials I need, then after the fact, a lot of times I don't find the quality of those kits to be consistent enough to keep reordering them and then use the content and replicate that experiment, but I'll piecemeal the equipment myself.

Speaker 1 (21:38):

When you find that happens and you open the kit and the test strips are outdated and you're like, oh, these aren't going to work, is there anything that you can do with any of them? Do you take

Speaker 3 (21:51):

In the past? If I notice it in advance, I can call and I can ask them to replace them, and I haven't had much trouble, but a lot of times it just takes so long by the time it runs through all of the people that have to be involved after the fact. Yeah.

Speaker 1 (22:08):

Where do you go get last minute test strips?

Speaker 3 (22:10):

Well, yeah, I would have to try to go back to the company. It's not easy to get them at a store or I'll go to my colleagues and say, Hey, you have any extra glucose test strips, and hope somebody can help me out. So it can be really frustrating for the kids too, because they do all this work and they're not getting the results that they are looking for. Yeah,

Speaker 1 (22:34):

That makes sense. Yeah. Do you participate in any of the social media face group for biology

Speaker 3 (22:47):

Or, yeah, I'm a member of a Facebook group for AP environmental science teachers, which is incredible.

Speaker 1 (22:55):

What kind of things do you guys share there?

Speaker 3 (22:58):

Everything from tips and tricks to materials to pacing guides to, Hey, this is how I use problem-based instruction, or This is how I'm using flipped classroom versus I tried this flipped classroom and it was a disaster. Things like that. Really incredible resource. College board is down today, FYI, so we get a lot of that information through there. Some of the people are connected to college board. They, excuse me, produce content for them or their past graders, and so they're a little more involved and they'll say, oh, I was in touch with college board and so I know that this is going to take 48 hours to be rectified or it's an incredible resource.

Speaker 1 (23:49):

Are there any either on Facebook or LinkedIn or Twitter, do you do any of those? No. Okay. Facebook

Speaker 3 (23:57):

Only is the only one I have.

Speaker 1 (23:58):

Facebook only. Are there any vendors that you follow on Facebook?

Speaker 3 (24:02):

No.

Speaker 1 (24:03):

Okay.

Speaker 3 (24:05):

I'm not a huge social. I say the only reason I have Facebook is for my Apes group.

Speaker 1 (24:10):

That says a lot though.

Speaker 3 (24:12):

Yeah. I don't do social media otherwise. I'm too old.

Speaker 1 (24:17):

So let's see what else I had in here. Have you participated in any material review committees where a district comes in and says, Hey, we're going to change the way we do environmental science or those kinds of things and they pull together review committees?

Speaker 3 (24:41):

No. I have attended though, as somebody who was interested in purchasing items, not in the presentation, but I have gone to other high schools and looked at some of their things.

Speaker 1 (24:55):

Okay. Do you know a little bit about how those works? I hear about them from time to time, but I don't really know much about them.

Speaker 3 (25:02):

So the one I'm particularly thinking of was about these anatomy tables that another district, it was a former colleague of ours who now works for a different district. She received grant money, purchased these anatomy tables, and we went to go see them,

Speaker 1 (25:19):

But they like the big long ones. I think they're called an or something like that.

Speaker 3 (25:26):

Really it all digital?

Speaker 1 (25:29):

Yeah.

Speaker 3 (25:29):

Yeah. It was incredible. We never wound up purchasing and it was just out of our price range for what we did, but I was part of that team that went to go see them and provide feedback to my own district about pros and cons and did we think it was worth it.

Speaker 1 (25:47):

Okay. So your district person then said, Hey, Vanessa, we know you went to go see those. What did you think? Should we get them? Is it worth the money? Yes,

Speaker 3 (25:56):

Correct.

Speaker 1 (25:57):

What other kind of questions did they ask you?

Speaker 3 (26:01):

In what ways were the students using them? How frequently did the teachers make them part of their lessons?

Speaker 1 (26:09):

Okay.

Speaker 3 (26:10):

All right. Does it come with prepackaged materials or did the teachers have to come up with all their own lessons? That was another big thing that we talked about.

Speaker 1 (26:20):

Is there anything just within your district that somebody would, just thinking about that table for a minute, that anybody would kick it out as a potential purchase where they would go, Nope, that's a deal breaker acre.

Speaker 3 (26:37):

It would probably go not one person. I would say there would be a couple people involved in that decision where we'd kind of weigh the pros and cons, but I can't, sometimes it would be just money that's not financially feasible. In that situation, they kind of knew the dollar amount going in and the deciding factor was that they just weren't using it enough to make it cost effective. That sense they started out and it was full of Wow, but for that kind of money, if you're not using it almost every day, what's the point kind of thing.

Speaker 1 (27:14):

Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

Speaker 3 (27:16):

But I would say money is probably one that would be a single factor that says that's out.

Speaker 1 (27:22):

Okay.

Speaker 3 (27:22):

Other than that, I think it would be a group decision.

Speaker 1 (27:28):

Yeah. The other thing that I've heard that I don't know if other people experience is I heard one teacher say, if any of the materials seem like they don't meet DEI initiatives or they seem stereotypical or those kinds of things, that that's a reason. Is that a thing in your district?

Speaker 3 (27:50):

Absolutely. Also, the ability, if you're providing us with resources, how secure are they? Are my students going to be able to Google it and get all the answers? Then it's a waste to us. They're not saving me any time because my kids are just cheating their way through it.

Speaker 1 (28:07):

So

Speaker 3 (28:09):

We went through looking for a lot of technology programs last year to support our state science test, and that was a huge one. Alright, this is not covering our standards, or the kids can google these questions or there's just not enough questions or the quality of the questions isn't good enough. That was a huge piece of our department time last year.

Speaker 1 (28:38):

Were those question test banks or were they the software that runs the assessment?

Speaker 3 (28:44):

No, they were the test bank for us to use as practice in the classroom leading up to that assessment.

Speaker 1 (28:51):

Okay, that makes sense. Yeah, I would definitely think you would not want those answers sitting out there on the web for your students

Speaker 3 (28:57):

And a lot of them, they just haven't figured out how to keep it secure.

Speaker 1 (29:03):

And I mean, the fact of the matter is students are going to be Googling in the future. That's what they

Speaker 3 (29:09):

Absolutely. On the part of the companies, we get it sometimes it's not them that is putting it out there. It's other teachers post answer keys and it's hard to police all that, but if it's already out there, well then we're done. Why would we purchase that? If we could buy some time with it, maybe it's worth it. Okay.

Speaker 1 (29:34):

We talked a little bit about how you buy along the way. If you're running out of test strips or those kinds of things. Do you ever have to go to a local store or to Amazon or to the hardware store or those kinds of things?

Speaker 3 (29:50):

Yes. We have a budget. There are pre-approved vendors that we can use. For us, a big one is ShopRite.

Speaker 1 (29:57):

ShopRite

Speaker 3 (29:58):

Really. I'm running a lab with eggs, chicken, eggs, and I needed vinegar, chicken, eggs and maple syrup. Well, those are three things that are cheaper at ShopRite than anywhere else, and I need them fresh. So we just, there's a team of biology teachers. Most of us carry out the same lab and one person will say, all right, I'm going to go get the ShopRite card. We have a budget on our ShopRite card. We have to provide the lab, and then we have to provide a receipt of all the materials we purchased, who's using them, how many students, and then it gets submitted to our board office.

Speaker 1 (30:39):

You're very lucky there too because we've talked to some teachers that it comes right out of their pocket if they don't get it within their budget.

Speaker 3 (30:47):

Yeah, no, we are very lucky. Sometimes it's a paint and you'll just run to the store and pick it up yourself. It saves time. No one has to organize it and you have to submit all the paperwork. And this is bigger because we need a hundred eggs and X number of gallons of vinegar and maple syrup. But something that's quick that I do with just my classes, I'm going to buy it at ShopRite on my own to save myself time. But no, we are very fortunate here.

Speaker 1 (31:17):

Okay. So this is your time now to kind of talk to, pretend you're talking to the head of development teams at some of the bigger suppliers. Are there things out there that you wish somebody were providing that you wish that somebody came up with a lab for X or that they solved this problem for you or that they even made the purchasing process different? Anything that would make your life better or would improve the learning for students?

Speaker 3 (31:51):

I think that one area that would really be helpful is state specific materials that meet state, like I mentioned, our state science tests. There's very little out there that supports the way in which that I can present to my students that supports the way in which they're tested. So like I explained earlier, we went through a process of looking for digital software to help support our students in that area, or even some inquiry-based better specific to that kind of learning that would help them achieve better scores on those standardized tests that are not across the board. Every state handles things differently. So that would be an area where I think that we would really find a lot of help in because it's hard. It's kind of like we're chasing this moving target, which is why I don't think companies have really gotten involved in it either.

Speaker 1 (32:56):

Do you do in New Jersey, do you do multidimensional testing so that you're testing like cross-cutting concepts and science and engineering practices? You do? Yes, we do. Is that the part that's difficult to find support for or is it the DCIS as well?

Speaker 3 (33:16):

Both. Both? Yeah.

Speaker 1 (33:18):

Okay.

Speaker 3 (33:19):

Dcis less so for sure. We have much more material that support those, but those engineering and those cross-cutting standards, being able to provide the students with an experience that they can then carry over to that testing is difficult. There's not a lot out there that helps us to support them in that way. We come up with materials on our own, but if we could get something that was a little bit more, I don't want to say canned, but a little more catered to that would really save us a lot of time and energy.

Speaker 1 (33:53):

What would it look like? Would it be something that was electronic on the web? Would it be something that

Speaker 3 (34:00):

Is, I think it needs to be a combination. There needs to be a way in which we can kind of replicate it on the web so that they can answer questions like they're taking that test, but also materials in the classroom that say, okay, maybe you do X, Y, and Z with your students. Some of it is maybe lessons, some of it is experimentation, and then these are questions that they would see on a state test to measure whether they understood.

Speaker 1 (34:33):

Okay. So if you've got a portion that covers the crosscutting concepts and the science and engineering practices, are those open-ended? Write me a explanation and a reasoning or

Speaker 3 (34:52):

No, that's more for ap and there are more resources that kind of meet those needs because college board's been around for a long time, it's less of a moving target, and college board has put out a lot of those resources themselves, which has been hugely helpful. But for a state test, it's going to bridge all of our courses. So it's your, your physics and your environmental. I've got kids that haven't taken all four of those classes. How can I bring in some of those concepts and then teach it from the approach of the biology teacher? And then those questions are interpret data, interpret graphs. Some of them might be multiple choice multi-select. A lot of times they have to scroll through several tabs to be able to see all of the data that they're looking at.

Speaker 1 (35:52):

So if they're interpreting data, are they, I'm getting at whether or not everything is multiple choice or whether or not there are written portions of the assessment that have to be evaluated by a teacher.

Speaker 3 (36:06):

Short answer, written assessments, couple words, not like paragraph or a few sentences even.

Speaker 1 (36:14):

Okay.

Speaker 3 (36:15):

Yeah.

Speaker 1 (36:16):

Let's see. I think Kimberly, if you want to pop in, I think I've got all my main questions answered. If you have questions for Vanessa,

Speaker 2 (36:30):

I do. And it's a little bit selfish or whatever. My youngest son was very bright, ended up being a national merit scholar, but deaf. And so I always ask about, or I like to ask about differentiation and how much that happens in your classroom. It happens. Okay. And if it would be helpful for, I mean, do the supplies you get allow for differentiation or come?

Speaker 3 (37:04):

Some do, and it depends on the course. And in an AP that kind of lends itself a little more to just differentiation on choice. So a lot of those resources give the students, alright, we're going to have you collect data for two weeks and then we're going to let you choose how you'd like to manipulate and collect some more data. So there's a lot of differentiation already built into those types of assessments or laboratories on more of a standard level course where you see a wide variety of students. A lot of that differentiation comes from us. We create it so we will provide for the students more of the like, all right, if you've mastered this, then let's move on to this. If you are still struggling with this, here's some more reinforcement here where the students kind of work through stations or

Speaker 1 (38:06):

There needs missing along those lines that would help you specifically in the life sciences for either remediation or

Speaker 3 (38:15):

Accelerate. Yeah, I would say that there's not a lot out there. What we do have, we really work together to come up with, we have really great support from our special ed team. I am fortunate enough to team teach, so a lot of that comes from them or us brainstorming and putting together things as a team where my blind spots are kind of covered by them and vice versa. And so we can come together and they'll point out, and we have a really great child study team that will say, I have a blind student this year. And so she brought to my attention that as long as I put it in this format, then the student has the opportunity to change all of these different factors to make it more helpful for her. I would've never known that it was an easy switch for me and really enhanced her learning. Not that she was struggling. The student happens to be really a phenomenal student who just really goes and gets it, but we made it easier for her so that she didn't have to climb a mountain every time she did a task.

Speaker 1 (39:22):

Yeah, that's important.

Speaker 3 (39:23):

She could just access the material in the ways in which her, at the ease at which her classmates were. And so I really rely on my colleagues for that. There are not a lot of support that I find available to me.

Speaker 1 (39:38):

Okay. Kim, what other questions you have? I want to be respectful of time and I want to be respectful of the fact that Vanessa's got a sore throat going on, so I don't want to make her talk the whole time. What are questions do you have?

Speaker 2 (39:53):

Well, the only thing I would add is what about language acquisition?

Speaker 3 (39:57):

We don't really do language acquisition in my school because it's covered in our other high school. We're a regional district and all of our ELL students attend the other high school. So it's very rare that I come across a student that is struggling with language acquisition because if you fall under that category, you go there, we handle more of the special ed, they kind of divide them up between the two high schools. So we don't have a ton of experience in that area.

Speaker 2 (40:27):

That's fascinating.

Speaker 3 (40:28):

Yeah.

Speaker 2 (40:31):

It's the way textbook really would work. Yeah.

Speaker 1 (40:36):

Kim, do you want to wrap us up with next steps for Vanessa?

Speaker 2 (40:40):

Yes. So if not this afternoon, Monday morning, you'll get an email for me thanking you for participating. And you made me want to be part of your classroom. So this is wonderful. And in that will be, we'll talk about the $95 gift card that we had said it was an Amazon card, but it's actually coming up. It's a Visa card and it's going to come directly from Daylene and her email address. And then also in there, I'll ask if you think of something this weekend or in the future that was like, you know what? This would've been a perfect, I really want this on my wishlist. Let me know and we'll forward on that information. And then also if you would like to be a part of a future study, not necessarily this topic, but something else that a client of ours will be asking if you would be willing to do that.

Speaker 3 (41:40):

Okay, great.

Speaker 1 (41:42):

Okay, so I'm definitely sending out those gift cards today. So expect it today. If for some reason you don't see it, check to see if it got caught in your spam filter. And if it just doesn't show up, send Kim an email and she's like a blood hail where those things are concerned and she will track it down. Thank you. So we're all good that way.

Speaker 3 (42:04):

Did you get my email saying that I don't need Tuesday? Yes.

Speaker 2 (42:09):

So thank you very much.

Speaker 3 (42:10):

My computer shut down on me and when I went back in the first time was already blacked out, so I just want to make sure that that got cleared

Speaker 2 (42:17):

Up. Yes. No, no, that was, yep. Nope, it's all good. And I was thinking, I didn't even know the system would let you do that, so it was like, whoa, okay.

Speaker 3 (42:27):

I was like, oh no, I have two appointments and when the invitation came in, I declined one hoping that that would clear it up. But I'm glad you emailed.

Speaker 2 (42:35):

Yes. And

Speaker 1 (42:37):

Thank you again, Vanessa, for just all that you do for students. We really appreciate it and we appreciate all that extra that you put into it for differentiation and thinking of new ways to teach familiar topics to students. So thank you for all that you do for students. We really appreciate it.

Speaker 3 (42:54):

Thank you.

Speaker 1 (42:56):

Yeah, thank you.

Speaker 3 (42:57):

Bye bye. Good weekend.

Speaker 2 (42:59):

You too.

Speaker 1 (43:01):

Let's see, Kim, do you want to hang on for just a second? Okay. I'm going to stop our recording.

Daylene Long (00:02):

That will automate it with Rev. So pick up that recording and do the rest of the work. So that's the important part, and we can practice when we're off the line with Libby. Okay. Okay.

Kimberly Herder (00:18):

Cool. Admitter,

Daylene Long (00:33):

We kind of match today.

Kimberly Herder (00:35):

Yes, we do.

Daylene Long (00:49):

Libby, can you hear us? There she is.

Kimberly Herder (01:27):

Good morning. Libby Frost.

Daylene Long (01:31):

Oh,

Kimberly Herder (01:41):

Generally the lower left corner next to your, or at least for me, it's next to my one should video.

Daylene Long (01:55):

No, it's on your end. We're early so don't be too stressed about it. We'll figure it out. Put the chat on.

Kimberly Herder (02:52):

I can read lip read. You say mine is in the lower left next to the, looks like a microphone next to the thing that looks like the whatever camera. What about your sound? I'm

L. Frost (03:42):

Just clicking stuff.

Daylene Long (03:43):

There you go. You got it.

Kimberly Herder (03:45):

You Got me? Yeah, don't unclick. Whatever you just did. Okay. Okay.

Daylene Long (03:49):

Nevermind Jordan.

Kimberly Herder (03:53):

Yay.

Daylene Long (03:55):

Yay. That's the thing is when you call someone in to help you with tech support, man, it gets fixed right then. Right. Okay. Let me just make sure I've got all my files up. Kim, do you want to start us off?

Kimberly Herder (04:10):

Sure. Well, first thank you very much for meeting with us, for doing this. What you say is going to make a difference and we want to hear what you have to say. So if you could take a minute and just tell us a little bit about yourself. So I'm with Daylene Long and she's the lead researcher and I'm going to in a minute, step off the camera, but I'll still be here and do the technical things that I wasn't able to help you with there as we go through it. But if you could take a minute and just tell us about yourself.

L. Frost (04:48):

Okay. I live in Tennessee and I

Kimberly Herder (04:53):

Have

L. Frost (04:53):

Been teaching for 28 years. I teach science. I've taught everything from physical science, environmental science, life science, anatomy and physiology. But mainly I teach Biology one, which is a end of course tested subject in the state of Tennessee. And I don't know what else to add to that.

Daylene Long (05:25):

No, that's super helpful. What city in Tennessee are you in?

L. Frost (05:30):

Well, I'm in Decatur County, which is almost equal distance between Nashville and Memphis.

Daylene Long (05:38):

Okay, so it's east? No, it's south of West. West,

L. Frost (05:44):

Right. Southwest.

Daylene Long (05:47):

Okay. I have family that lives in Pulaski. They just moved there from Orange County.

L. Frost (05:55):

Pulaski is a little more south than I am, but yes, I know where Pulaski is.

Daylene Long (06:01):

Yeah. Okay. And then we'll talk a little bit about assessments too, since you're teaching a course that is assessed for state standards. So that's great. Let me give you just kind of an overview of what we're going to do today and then we'll dive in.

L. Frost (06:20):

Okay.

Daylene Long (06:21):

So we are recording today. It's just for note taking purposes. I promise that you will not end up on YouTube and I'm not going to ask you to do a TikTok dance or anything like that. It's really just for more accurate note taking.

L. Frost (06:36):

That is fun.

Daylene Long (06:37):

And then, let's see. Our overall goal today is we have a client who wants to better know how to serve teachers and students with, as you are so well aware, things have changed in the last few years rapidly, and we want to know better ways to make sure that you think your vendors are reliable and maybe even that they have moments where they unexpectedly delight you. And we're going to ask too about maybe even situations where you've purchased materials and you were disappointed or you weren't happy in those kinds of things. We really want to try to improve things

(07:19):

And at the end of the interview, you'll have a chance to talk directly to the product developers and say, Hey, you know what? This has always been missing. I wish this were here. Or I wish that students in 10 or 15 years had this or that. Teachers need to be supported more in this way now because things are changing and we want to make sure we're doing the best job that we can to support teachers and students. We're going to ask a lot of what, why, how kind of questions just so we get a full context. And for some educators it helps to kind of think of Kim and I as filming a documentary, Take you through the beginning and ask you questions and all the way through the end and we'll ask, follow-up questions along the way and that kind of stuff. It's really a conversation.

L. Frost (08:25):

Okay.

Daylene Long (08:28):

So with all of that out of the way then, you had mentioned in the survey that you took with us that you had purchased some life science materials in the last six months or so. Tell us a little bit about that and start from the very moment that you were like, okay, I definitely am going to need to place an order.

L. Frost (08:50):

Well, as what our school does is as a department, we talk about what are we going to do for the upcoming year. And so we had this discussion at the end of this past school year, so back in May. And then we talked about this is what we want to do coming up and what as a whole department do we need to purchase in the way of, so it's almost like a year in advance planning and we always are so excited about, oh, we're going to do this and this and this, and we never really get around to some of it. Actually, I'm sorry, I'm moving an interview and so can I ask A

Daylene Long (09:38):

Quick question? Yes. So when you're planning in May, and let's pretend it's this year, so May of 2023, were you planning for the 20 24 25 school year or the 20 23, 24 school year?

L. Frost (09:55):

23, 24 because we were finished. We had just completed in May. We had just completed the 2223 school year and we were preparing for this current school year, which we're finished with the first half. Actually, today is our last day.

Daylene Long (10:19):

So

L. Frost (10:20):

Yes. And so we just look at, this is a list of the labs that we wanted to do this past year. This is what we did, this is what we didn't do, this is what I wish I had different. So we go through that whole thing and we just kind of make a shopping list. Will we need beakers, will we need, and most of the time it's chemicals that we will need for different types of tests and those sometimes consumable type things like that. But for activities, I have some beads and pipe cleaners that I use to build DNA key chains and do mitosis and miosis with kind of manipulatives. And so they don't just have a picture to look at. They actually have to move the parts and pieces and we will just sit down and say, these are the things that we want to do and make a list.

(11:28):

And then usually we end up having to pare it down over the summer. They'll say, this is approved or not approved, you need to take a certain amount money-wise off of we need you to reduce $200 or reduce whatever. And then we'll do that and submit that whatever that final cost assessment. And once we have the actual cost that they'll approve for us, then we can place an order and we have to separate out by companies because chemistry usually goes with Flynn Biology. I usually go with Carolina and sometimes we overlap and get some stuff from ward wards and those are our three major suppliers that we get items from.

Daylene Long (12:30):

Okay. So a few questions. When do you get the items for the next school year and yeah, when do you get the items for the next school year? If you're placing your, well, let me back up. You're having your meetings in May to talk about what you might need and then placing your orders over the summer. But is that June Correct?

L. Frost (12:53):

Yes. Usually July is when our fiscal year, July 1st is when we can actually purchase something for what we have currently. July 1St, 2023, we were able to put in our purchase and get a purchase order through the school and put in our purchases for the 2324 school year. So we went through and we ordered, and that way we get pretty much everything that we need as long as it's not something that's live materials or something like that. If we have to purchase it later when it comes closer to time, we of course don't purchase that early, but we try to have almost everything that we need when school starts in August.

Daylene Long (13:44):

Okay. And then so what kind of budget do you typically have that you're working with? When you're talking about that July order, is it range or It depends. It depends on

L. Frost (14:03):

What our district has done. The year that we purchased textbooks, we didn't have as big of a budget for lab supplies that year

(14:20):

Because it was sort of, we used more of our money in, I mean books were allotted, I'm sure. I don't know how all of that works on the budgeting end and with our school board and how all of that works. But we usually have, and we're a small school, but we have a couple thousand dollars to work with a lot of times and it depends on what we want and we will kind of say, Hey, I would like to do this. And if we set up a plan, if it's something like I want to do a DNA gel electrophoresis for example, and I want to get a couple of those test kits. And so if it's something of a large expense plus that would be something we only use once and each semester or something that that's a larger purchase just for one activity. And so if I want to do that, we'll put that in the budget for, we'll do that for this year, or we'll say we can't do it this year, we'll cut back and then I'll plan to do it next year or the next year or something like that.

Daylene Long (15:53):

So

L. Frost (15:53):

We'll scale back each year until we have that that's the one thing that we want to get for something upcoming. Does that make sense? I feel like I'm not explaining things very well.

Daylene Long (16:08):

No, you're doing a great job. I just know that it's complicated. So that's probably where that comes in. So tell me about this last year's ordering then. What kind of things that did you get? Who did you buy them from? Did you have any moments where you were particularly delighted or frustrated?

L. Frost (16:33):

I know we got some of our chemicals, the chemical indicators that we needed. Usually our chemicals come from Flinn Scientific and I'm out of the loop when it comes to chemistry stuff. But for biology, we needed the Benedict solution and Biore reagent iodine, things like that for testing of biomolecules. And I know some of the other teachers for biology too, they had dissections specimens that they needed to order. And I want to say we got those specimen from Carolina Biological. Do you

Daylene Long (17:30):

Remember what they were?

L. Frost (17:33):

Actually showed me the list today that she had fetal pigs, earthworm crayfish, frogs, and I can't remember, there was something else. It may have been the bird. Bird or perch. I can't remember. Okay,

Daylene Long (17:55):

That's helpful. And those came through Carolina, I think you said?

L. Frost (17:58):

Yes.

Daylene Long (17:59):

Okay. Okay. Anything else in terms of LabWare or technology or kits or any of those types of things?

L. Frost (18:15):

When we order, I'm not really sure because I'm not the person that orders most of the time. I just handle my list. I look through my magazines and things and find what I'm looking for and say this is what I want. But glassware and equipment falls to our chemistry teacher and he makes sure all of our equipment's working and things like that. So microscopes and microscope slides. I do get microscope slides and things like that, but still when I have trouble with that, anything a bulb is out or the focus knobs need adjusting or any kind of maintenance, I put a tag on it and he takes care of it. So that's nice.

Daylene Long (19:09):

It is. So you mentioned that he gets most of his stuff from Flynn. Yes. Does that mean that he gets most of the technology stuff from Flynn then if you needed a gel electrophoresis kit, are you recommending who to buy from or is I would would find what

L. Frost (19:28):

I wanted and usually then it would just come down to the price per kit or I would compare a couple of different ones to decide which one I think I like better. And sometimes cheaper is not what I want. I want something that's a little more expensive because there's something about it that I like better or so we don't always just go with the cheapest, but cost is one of the top things that we look at just because we have to mind our P's and Q's and pinch pennies and try to save money and things like that.

Daylene Long (20:14):

What kinds of things make it more attractive to you if something's just a little bit more expensive, but what kinds of things would make you like it better? And if you've got any specific examples that you can use where you thought, oh, I picked this one. Because

L. Frost (20:39):

I think when I'm looking at my catalogs, I like to look at catalogs, but a lot of stuff I do online now searching around for stuff. Kids today, they like their tiktoks and they like their videos and stuff, and when I make 'em put their phones away, then I better be ready to be the replacement to be the entertainment for that time period. And so I like things that are colorful. I like things that I can hand them and say, make this work. Do the concept that we just talked about, show me and put it together. And so that they can do, I use myself, I use a lot of Legos and things, building blocks and stuff like that, even to do chemical equations for photosynthesis and stuff. I'll give them a bag of Legos and say, show me the formula, make it with the Legos. That's

Daylene Long (21:58):

Fascinating. You were the first person I've talked to that does that. Gosh, I have so many thoughts on that. Where did you learn to do that?

L. Frost (22:11):

My nephew who was a senior this year actually when he was little, he played Legos a lot and we played Legos and I was trying to figure out how to get my students to look at glucose as six carbons C six. And so my little nephew is four years old and I was like, look, we've got six red ones, six red blocks that can be carbon and just click stuff together. And he says he still as a senior, he still remembers doing stuff like that with Aunt Libby at Christmas when everybody was playing outside, but he couldn't, he was physically not able to. And we sat and played Legos and I said, this is how an amino acid can hook to another amino acid and we can build a protein. And we did a lot of stuff with Legos just because he had Legos and that was what he played with since he couldn't go outside and play.

Daylene Long (23:18):

I have to tell you, Libby, I actually got a little teary eyed when you told that story because it's such a beautiful example of teaching and learning and also just making accommodations in life when you're at that Christmas dinner and he can't go outside and those kinds of things. That's a beautiful story. Thank you so much for sharing that.

L. Frost (23:44):

You're welcome.

Daylene Long (23:47):

So I like what you were saying then about them getting the kids to demonstrate what it is that they know. And it's an interesting perspective too, that you're thinking about it from the standpoint of if they turn off their phones and they don't have TikTok and they don't have that, how are you going to be engaging enough with these Students?

L. Frost (24:12):

It's very hard because they're ready for you to do something and they scroll past. I see something that doesn't catch my interest. They scroll past and I feel like when I'm in front, you've got me for a whole block of 85 to 90 minutes and you can't scroll past, how am I going to engage them this whole time? They get bored so quickly and so easily and they don't want to focus. And it's very, in the 27, 28 years I've been teaching, it's an adjustment and it's changed a lot. When

Daylene Long (24:55):

Did you think that started changing where you started really realizing that I really need to engage them differently so that they don't try to scroll past me?

L. Frost (25:07):

Yeah, I don't know. It's been at least 10 years or maybe even more 10 to 15 years that they've been, I'm here to be entertained more so than anything else. And it's hard not to get frustrated and become jaded as a teacher thinking the kids don't want to be here. They don't want to learn anything, not the case all the time. There are times that they do want to learn that they do have questions, they are still curious. And I teach high school, but a lot of 'em are ready to just let me go to work. Just let me get out of here. Just let me. And I think some of the innocence of even high school kids, it's lost in the past 10 years or so. Say

Daylene Long (26:04):

A little bit more about that. What do you mean by the innocence?

L. Frost (26:11):

The curiosity of wanting to learn something just so that they can to know it. I remember my kids coming home from school and say, guess what I learned today? I found out this or I found out that. And the kids being so excited. And nowadays it's hard to get that kind of reaction from kids. They're like, eh, whatever. They've seen it all. They've seen it all. And I don't know, that doesn't interest me now or something. But that's kind of what I mean by that.

Daylene Long (26:51):

They have access to it all at their fingertips now. Yes, they feel that they can Google anything or chat GPT, anything and find the answers I think is where young people are becoming jaded, where least when I was growing up, you had to, when somebody taught you something new, that was pretty cool because it wasn't in the encyclopedia or whatever. That's just a really interesting perspective. And thinking about that a little bit more, are there things you wish were available for students or for teachers who are teaching this generation?

L. Frost (27:36):

Wow. I don't know. I guess I should have thought about some of this beforehand. I wish I had gotten a question list so I could be thinking about what do I wish was available.

Daylene Long (27:52):

Libby, that's a good idea. We'll consider that definitely with future interview To

L. Frost (27:58):

Think about beforehand before the interview. Let's see, things that I wish textbooks are, so I hate to say the word outdated, but I don't even use my textbooks. And there's a wealth of information in those textbooks and we spend a lot of money on textbooks, but I can't tell you the last time that I handed out textbooks because I was talking to, and it was my honors classes and they had their computers out and some of them are very engaged in their computer while I'm talking and I'm like, what are you looking up? And they said, well, you were talking about sickle cell anemia. And it says right here that they were already looking up stuff about sickle cell anemia that I was talking about, and I thought they weren't paying attention to me, but they were wanting to know more. And so they just got access through the internet and through just their phones and stuff that it's not paying attention to me, but they can look up and dig more.

(29:26):

But then I have those students that whenever I call on 'em and I'm like, what are you looking at? And they're watching Monster truck racing or something, so it's hard to tell what are they into, what are they doing? What has their attention when I'm here saying stuff and then I ask 'em a question and they either are in a totally different realm or they're keyed in and they've got more to add. So it's hard for me as a teacher to look at that situation and judge who's actually into the lesson and who's off in la la land doing something else. Their mind is on their job or whatever they're doing after school or how can I stay awake?

Daylene Long (30:17):

Yeah, that's really interesting. Are there any resources you wish that you had? So maybe if you're up there and you're teaching about sickle cell anemia that you, I don't know. I guess what I'm hearing from you is that students are accessing multiple ways of getting and assessing information. So are there things that you feel are missing that you wish you had?

L. Frost (30:52):

I would like to have access to mean videos. There are some videos out there, whether they're YouTube or One of my favorite resources even for high school is Amoeba Sisters. The Amoeba Sisters, YouTube, they're on YouTube and I'm sure that they make a living doing what they do, but I'm like, they explained what I'm trying to explain with better pictures

(31:22):

And the animations is kind of, it's kind of, sorry about that. I'm sorry. Intercom. So it's kind of on a child's level because it's cartoons, but then it's talking about very complex ideas. I really like the videos. Videos and computer graphic type things. Manipulatives like the Legos and stuff. Magnetic. I had some magnets that I used, but it's almost like I feel like I had to do 'em myself. And I can find them now on different catalogs where they stick to your magnetic board, the pictures of the phases of mitosis and things like that, and they can move 'em around and get 'em in the right place. But anytime that they can get up and move stuff around, move from table to table and pick the one that has, I give 'em a card and everybody gets a card and then they have to go in and find the display that it matches what's on their card or something like that.

(32:49):

So anything that can get 'em into that and thinking on their own, Pick you up. Now we'll come to the office, But still a lot of times I'll give them their card and they'll be like, I don't know what this is. And I'm like, oh, come on, we just did this in class. You know what this is? Looks like I showed you a picture. Go find it, find it. And they're like, I don't know. Or can I look it up on my phone? They want to look it up on their phone and then go and find it. So that relying on something else and not having the knowledge right there, but I do it too. I'm like, oh, if I need a recipe or something, I'm just going to look it up. So I fall into that too. And I feel like I don't want to judge them or say they can't do that.

Daylene Long (33:48):

That's a good example of how things have changed. So at least when I was growing up, I learned to cook a recipe from my mother. There wasn't really anything that was written. She taught me how to cook it with whatever was in the house or what are those kinds of things. But kids today, oh boy, do I sound old when I say that there's different resources available for them. So those things have changed. But what I'm hearing too is that you're seeing it display itself in maybe needing more of movement around the room and hands-on manipulatives and connecting things with their hands and their brains and those types of things. Yes.

L. Frost (34:41):

So

Daylene Long (34:42):

That's really interesting. Are there resources besides the Amoeba sisters that you like?

L. Frost (34:53):

Some of the video wise, there are some people that put out some good information videos. Professor Dave Explains is a good one. Bozeman Science is another good one that I use his stuff and Crash course

Daylene Long (35:20):

Is

L. Frost (35:20):

Another one. Those are usually my go-tos because I feel like I can trust the content and it's free access with YouTube.

Daylene Long (35:33):

Yeah, crash course I think does something. Or maybe it's HHMI does something with sickle cell anemia too that I heard people like. Okay, so let me flip through my questions. Libby, I wish I had had you for a teacher when I was young. Do you do any dissections in your classes?

L. Frost (35:58):

They have really, in the state of Tennessee in standard biology one, they have taken dissection completely out of our curriculum so that our entire first level biology curriculum can be completed without any dissection whatsoever. And so I myself have not dissected in years, about eight years I'm guessing. But biology two is a survey of the kingdoms, the different kingdoms and lum with plants, animals, fungus, all of that. And so they do more dissection.

Daylene Long (36:51):

Okay. So do you know what has driven that change that the biology one, there's less dissection

L. Frost (37:00):

Testing. It's going to be my number one answer. The testing, everything is so heavy on testing and I think that at this point, whether it's at the national level, the state level, whatever is that your test results are the quickest way to prove this is what I know. And some kids do not test well. I've known really, really smart kids that don't test well and I've known lazy kids that soak it all up and then they test like their geniuses and then later on they're flipping burgers at McDonald's or something. And so I don't know that testing is the best measure of somebody's knowledge or their ability, but I feel like we are heavily leaning on those tests and test results more than anything.

Daylene Long (38:11):

That was a wonderful summary. So thinking about testing since that's one of your goals at the end of your biology one, is there anything that you wish would help get kids ready for the test itself? And I don't necessarily even mean content, I mean just any resources you think that are missing to teach them how to do the testing or anything like that that would support you and that would also support students

L. Frost (38:48):

Study skills in general, flashcards and as teachers, we're only given an hour and a half with these kids each day. And in that amount of time, it's really hard for teachers to push as much information as we can into their little minds. But the Quizlet is a great resource and I've used it more in the past than I do presently because I think it got to where you have to pay a membership kind of thing. And there's a lot of great ideas out there on teacher pay teacher and stuff, but I've lost my train of thought. That's okay. The things that, the things that we need to use for testing and review, kids still like the buzzer games and calling out the quick answers and things like that. They still really enjoy that kind stuff.

Daylene Long (40:11):

Okay, that's helpful. I'm flipping through my notes. And one of the other things I wanted to ask you is are there any vendors that you consider yourself to be particularly loyal to?

L. Frost (40:33):

The three main ones that I've mentioned being Flynn, Carolina and Wards, really off the top of my head, I can't think of any others.

Daylene Long (40:47):

Okay. And one of the things that came out of the survey that we sent was that reliability is very important to educators when choosing vendors. What does it mean to you that a vendor is reliable?

L. Frost (41:08):

Well, I know that I've needed some backup, some help if I can't figure out how this works, if it's not user-friendly, if I can't figure it out within a few minutes, then it's almost like, I don't want to say it's not worth my time, but it really, that's the way it feels. If I'm going to have to spend 30 or 45 minutes every time I try to get this activity going or whatever, if I've got to type everything up to put the questions in to play this game or whatever it is, the more work that I have to do, the less likely it is I'm going to do it again. And if having tech support available or pre-made tech stuff, if that's a thing, pre-made games, quiz games, that kind of stuff that would be worth paying for if it was easy to use. And I felt like things that are going to be more valuable if they're easy, take less time and still get the same job done, if that makes sense.

Daylene Long (42:33):

Yep. Would you add to that too? I was wondering when you were talking that you can easily match it to the state standard that

L. Frost (42:42):

Yes.

Daylene Long (42:43):

Okay.

L. Frost (42:45):

Yes. We do have a really good test bank that my district uses. I don't know. The site is Mastery Connect and it has all the questions. The way that you find questions is you have to put in the standard standard number and then it can pull up all of these different types of questions about that standard. And that's nice.

Daylene Long (43:22):

Yeah, that is. And do you put in for Tennessee State standards or for NGSS or DCIS or how do you do that?

L. Frost (43:34):

There's a dropdown when I click on it and we have, our school system has access to the Tennessee State standards as far as the national standards and stuff, they're not, I don't know, they may be on there. I haven't looked specifically because I just find Tennessee standards and click it and then I go find biology and then I start clicking and pulling out questions. So that makes it nice when I'm going to do a review and put 'em on teams, put the kids in teams and I can just click, this is our standard that we're learning about and I need 10 questions, click, click, click and pull 'em over. And then I've got it pulled up on my TV right here and the kids can buzz in or write their answer down on their little dry erase boards and it makes it easier. And I appreciate having that as an, I don't want to say it's new. I've had it for about three or four years with our county and district and that's made things a lot more simple so I can grab and go pretty quickly.

Daylene Long (44:54):

And I apologize for my cat who's decided To be Part of this phone call. She's probably hungry, so that's interesting. So I have a couple more questions and I know we're getting close to time and I want to be respectful to your time.

L. Frost (45:16):

Are

Daylene Long (45:17):

There any social media groups that you participate in that you find are helpful for you as a teacher? I

L. Frost (45:27):

Really, honestly, I don't do teacher social media. I don't have a Facebook. I do Instagram and Snapchat just with my kids.

Daylene Long (45:43):

I own adult children

L. Frost (45:46):

And I don't have any professional groups that I click with outside of my school time. And that's a terrible thing, but I've kind of scaled back on doing some of that.

Daylene Long (46:01):

Okay, you can't do everything right.

L. Frost (46:03):

My Dog

Daylene Long (46:04):

Or my cat out real fast. She is being a pain, aren't she?

(46:09):

Okay. So then the last question really gets to that notion of whether or not there are things out there that you wish existed for teachers or students, really your opportunity to talk to product development teams. And you're right, I should have given you those questions in advance. And so the other thing is, if for some reason you need more time on that, you're welcome to send me an email. If you think of Day or two a Week, send me an email. But that's kind of our last question for this is brainstorming any ideas for things you wish existed?

L. Frost (46:53):

Yeah, give me some time to think on that. Like I said, I'll definitely email you some of that stuff, but quick and easy labs, the kids love to go in the lab, but the truth is it takes so much time. It takes time away from classroom learning and getting those facts. You got to get all this information out to 'em and that's, but then they really love to go in the lab and even if it's just to play, because a lot of times that's what they think they're doing is playing. I'm like, did you understand the meaning of this lab? Did you get something out of it? And they were like, we mixed a bunch of stuff together. And I'm like, that's not the whole idea. But they do enjoy that. And like I said, the manipulatives, any kind of manipulatives and stuff like that, they make key chains and they can tell me, tell me about DNA when they get their key chain out and it's really nice for them to have something to show here it is, this is what it looks like, I made this cell, or this is DNA, it controls what I look like and stuff like that.

(48:22):

And even high school kids like that stuff. But I can't think of anything right off the top of my head that I think, I wish I had this or I wish I had that. The kids, they really like doing, seeing stuff and actually doing it. I'm like, let's just look at this video. And they said, can we do that? And I'm like, yes, but it would take so long for us to do that, but we can watch a two minute video.

Daylene Long (48:58):

Okay, that's interesting. And I will definitely make sure that you have my email so you can follow up with that. I'm going to bring Kim back in, see if she has any questions. And then we've just got a couple minutes left, so I want to make sure we're respectful of your time. Kim, do you have any questions and or do you want to walk Libby through next steps?

Kimberly Herder (49:20):

Both. So the question I have when you were talking about that, because the key chain and that kind of stuff just sounds,

Daylene Long (49:28):

Yeah,

Kimberly Herder (49:28):

It sounds great. If there were kits out there like that, what would be the best way for a manufacturer or whoever to let you know that they're out there?

L. Frost (49:47):

I don't know. I feel like manufacturers, like I told Daylene, the catalogs are the main way that I flip through catalogs and I find, but I know that there are teachers, the younger teachers than me, they look up stuff online. So online and even, oh my goodness, when I search for videos on YouTube, the advertisements that come up, even Grammarly comes up all the time. Grammarly. And I think that's a great thing to help with kids with writing and stuff like that. But those kind of ads, because I'm looking for education stuff, they'll pop up I guess. I don't know, but that's a good way I maybe, but I haven't seen anything for science supplies and things. I don't know.

Kimberly Herder (50:52):

Okay. Well that's a good answer.

L. Frost (50:55):

Well

Kimberly Herder (50:55):

Thank you for doing this. And I will send you an email in just a little bit that will have our contact information. So yes, please reach out with anything at any time that you have a question about or that you have an idea or would like us to pursue, that would be great. In the thank you email that I'm sending, I'm also going to ask the question if you'd be willing to be a part of something like this again, and we make sure we get you the questions ahead of time, because that is, I'm that way, I need to think about things. So yes, so that question will be in there as well.

L. Frost (51:36):

Alright.

Daylene Long (51:36):

And then I will send out your gift card. I usually do them at the end of the day after we've finished all of our interviews. So you expect it'll be later this afternoon and we're on the west coast and they'll give you, we a choice of a Visa gift card or a Target gift card or I think you could even do the whole thing in Starbucks if you decided that you wanted to do that. So you've got a few different choices in there as to how you want to receive your incentive.

L. Frost (52:11):

Okay.

Daylene Long (52:13):

So yeah, expect that later today. And Kim will make sure that you've got my email and her follow-up email as well. And thank you again for everything that you do for teachers and for students. For me, this was a very inspiring interview to hear from you on the different ways that you contact kids, that you really see where they are in their learning process to move them to the next step. And so I just want to thank you for all that you do for students.

L. Frost (52:52):

Well, thank you and you're welcome.

Daylene Long (52:56):

All right, we will talk to you again soon.

Kimberly Herder (52:58):

Yes. Happy last day. Happy new year or whatever you're supposed to say. See you Next year.

Daylene Long (53:06):

Alright, thank you very much. Bye

L. Frost (53:09):

Bye. Kim,

Daylene Long (53:11):

Do you want to stay on the line for just a second so I can show you a couple things? Okay. So I want to share before I do this, You

Kimberly Herder (53:23):

Want to stop recording first or do you need to leave that? I'm Not going

Daylene Long (53:26):

To stop recording because I want to show you where things are. So we are going to share screen and we're going to do that one. So tell me what you can see

Kimberly Herder (53:52):

At the bottom of my, well, I see your cursor moving around, but at the bottom of my screen I see the, yep, now you're rolling it up

Daylene Long (54:01):

Your

Kimberly Herder (54:01):

Bottom.

Daylene Long (54:02):

So there'll be a couple of different ways that you can stop recording or not and I'm not even sure if we are recording right now. Okay. I'm going to stop the share what you're going to find and I'm going to stop the recording.

Daylene Long (00:02):

All right. What do we know? Ms. Kimberly?

Kimberly Herder (00:05):

Patrick has been teaching on and off for almost 20 years. He did do some private sector stuff, work for a while, but came back to teaching it looks like about six years ago. And he's at a school Capital high school now. He's the department chair, science chair. It's an option school in a rougher part of town and interview only to get in and CTE focused, but not labeled that way from what I can tell from the curriculum, he has his master's from, oh, I didn't write it down. Oh, Marquette. And see, I think that's pretty much it. So that,

Daylene Long (01:06):

Oh, which vendors has he used?

Kimberly Herder (01:09):

Oh, Carolina and Flinn. And those were his top two. He put down Flinn though as singular as his, the one for respect. But when throughout the questioning, he did list Flinn as well, but he called out being Carolina.

Daylene Long (01:30):

He called out Carolina as far as top of mind brand awareness. Yes. Meaning when you think about people you trust that

Kimberly Herder (01:39):

Price. Yes, yes. But he does buy from Carolina and Flinn.

Daylene Long (01:43):

Okay, good to know. Anything else we should know about him?

Kimberly Herder (01:51):

I think it's going to be interesting because it's a brand new school, so I mean brand new, they renamed it and I mean, it looks like it used to be a large middle school or something that they have remodeled and rebranded as an option school. And this is its first full year and he's the department chair, so if anybody's going to be buying stuff, hopefully he will have been in that position and we'll see how he made those choices.

Daylene Long (02:24):

Okay. He's ready to come into our interview, so let's do it the way we did it last time. And you can greet him and introduce and build some rapport on that kind of stuff. And introduce me. Ready?

Kimberly Herder (02:40):

Yes.

Daylene Long (02:54):

Hello.

Kimberly Herder (02:55):

Hi. Patrick McGee.

Daylene Long (02:58):

Yeah, that's

Kimberly Herder (02:58):

Me. Okay, well I'm Kimberly Herder and I'm here with Daylene Long and she's the founder of Catapult Research and very happy to have you participate in this. And I was looking a little bit into the background and it sounds like Capital is a new school or newly. Well, tell me a little bit about it. I come from a place where I helped open a school that was being rebranded, so I'm particularly interested in that.

Patrick McGee (03:29):

Yeah, capital is in its eighth year. This is my second year with it, but we've just moved to a new building. So originally it was split between a north campus, a south campus, and then there was a pregnant and parenting program, which was originally known as the SAPAR program in Madison. And now we're all combined under one roof. So we have all the kids from the east and west campuses together along with about seven in the pregnant and parenting program right now. But that's increasing.

Kimberly Herder (04:01):

That's fantastic.

Daylene Long (04:03):

Interesting school.

Patrick McGee (04:05):

Yeah. When I moved to Madison, I worked at Epic for a year and then I decided to go back into education and I went to Capitals because it was an alternative, different kind of building.

Daylene Long (04:22):

Very cool. What did you do at Epic?

Patrick McGee (04:25):

I was a tester. I taught in Milwaukee, Wisconsin for eight years before I moved to Madison with my wife and I wanted to try something new and then I tried testing programs for a year and I didn't like that.

Daylene Long (04:42):

Well, hopefully you're happier being in the classroom and working with students.

Kimberly Herder (04:47):

So we're very happy that you've agreed to do this. And I'm going to step off camera, off Daylene iss going to run the interview. I may pop back in if there's something that technical difficulty or need to follow up on something. Okay.

Daylene Long (05:04):

Alright. See you soon. Yeah.

Daylene Long (05:07):

So let me just give you kind of an overview of the research we're doing. We're looking at science education, how people make the decisions that they make about the products that they're going to use, which companies they trust, and just kind of an overall picture of what it looks like when you're making decisions about what you're going to use. But the goal really is to be able to better understand and serve science educators. We know you guys are doing more with less. It seems like it's every year it gets a little bit more and a little bit less. So we want to make sure that we're putting systems in place to help support teachers and educators.

Daylene Long (05:58):

So we're recording today just for note taking purposes. I promise you won't end up on YouTube or America's Funniest videos or anything like that. And let's see what else. You'll see us asking a lot of what and why questions, just really trying to understand what you're thinking about and we'll kind of prompt you to go back and try and remember some of those things. There aren't any right or wrong answers and sometimes it helps people to think of it as Kim and I filming a documentary of how you're building up the labs that you're doing or how you work with your teachers and those kinds of things. So the descriptive part of telling a story is really, really helpful.

Patrick McGee (06:49):

Okay,

Daylene Long (06:51):

So let's see. You mentioned in your survey that you had bought Life Science materials in the last, I guess it was six months, a year, something like that. Tell me a little bit about what you bought.

Patrick McGee (07:07):

So in particular, I was kind of given this past year to design the science curriculum as I wanted to see it because right now I am the only science teacher at Capital, so we wanted to have a 1.5 position and they only got the one filled and so that's just kind of how it is. Sorry, my cat is extra needy right now.

Daylene Long (07:32):

That's okay. Well quite needy cats.

Patrick McGee (07:35):

Yeah, so I looked into a resource that I've used for years but never really have been able to buy a lot of the resources for it, but it was the argument driven inquiry books by the NSTA and pretty much did biology, chemistry, life science. What I wanted out of those things was given a budget, they kind of gave us some money. We were starting a new building to go into it, so I tried to get as many of the things that could be reused over and over, but thought process going into it was got an incubator so we can grow bacteria, got things to do, photosynthesis labs, cellular aspiration labs, and the idea was that as many things as I could do that were physical that they could see, I wanted to do that. And then supplement with, we're using Explore Learning Gizmos as another piece that's in the district to kind of supplement the things I can't do. Like I'm doing an embryo development gizmo right now because I just very well can't have them do BRYO development. So

Daylene Long (08:45):

A few questions going into that. Let's start with the argument based inquiry from NSTA. Do you remember the first time you encountered that program and what you thought of it?

Patrick McGee (08:58):

Yeah, that was 20 16, 20 17 I was doing a master's a postmaster's program with UWN in Milwaukee and NSF. And so we were looking for resources of things that we wanted to bring into the classroom and that was one of the things that was there and I really was a fan of the more open-ended nature of it rather than it just because, yeah, some of the labs are still kind of cookie cutter. Some of the students still need met me to give them the methods and they can't get that thinking there. But a lot of the questions and the argument part of it was more open-ended and now I actually prefer it more because I think it lends more support to English classes in my school, just like with for every school I've been in because when I was in Milwaukee I taught at North Division and Bradley Tech and they were I think the worst performing school in Wisconsin than the fifth worst performing school in Wisconsin. So reading levels have always been really low and arguments and things like that and being able to explain why on answers has been really low in all subjects. So I wanted to try to have my cake and eat it too, do labs and then also have students be able to speak more to what they were doing. I never had the ability to have the resources to do these labs is in depth until this year though.

Daylene Long (10:27):

Okay, so I want to make sure I understand. So part of the reason you chose it initially is you were introduced to it when you were becoming and studying to be a teacher and then what you like now that you're a practitioner is that it's supports English language arts and literacy development for the population that you're working with.

Patrick McGee (10:52):

Yeah, absolutely.

Daylene Long (10:53):

And then does it have a component for CER for the claim evidence reasoning type. Okay.

Patrick McGee (11:00):

Okay. Yeah, it's very big in the, okay, so tell me what the identity of this element is or tell me what this cell is, okay, why? And you have to go point to the data and go, oh, it was this color and it had the cell wall, so therefore it was this, okay, well why is it that color? Okay, well it's this. And then being able to build into that. A lot of why and how do you know this questions versus what's the answer yes or no? Yeah.

Daylene Long (11:29):

Does your state assessment assess for that? Do they have that kind of multidimensional or open portion to state assessments?

Patrick McGee (11:40):

Science realistically doesn't have that much of a state assessment. We're pretty much only assessed in the A CT in the middle school. I believe there's something science related, but I haven't, and they constantly are changing. I think I've seen five or six different state assessments in my 10 years of teaching. So I think that what we really are doing is that why part in the English part, because a lot of the English A CT or sorry, the writing part of the A CT, not the English is very much a, it is in most years that I've proctored, it has been almost like a DB Q in social studies where it's a couple pieces of things now make your claim based on this. And so that's kind of why I want to support it in that way. And then it also generates graphs and it generates data tables for them to have to analyze and be able to answer questions to, which is largely in the science A CT. So I'm thinking that those two approaches are the things that I'd like to do because data tables are only really done in math at our school and they just need a bit more support on that.

Daylene Long (12:59):

Makes a lot of sense. You've got the cross curricular going with both English language arts and with the math, so that makes a lot of sense. The gizmos. Talk about those for a minute. When were you first introduced to Gizmos?

Patrick McGee (13:15):

Same time, roughly the same time was really looking for a way to do digital labs. Different reason though, the school I worked at North Division, I had God, there was days, there was classes that I taught that had a 50% attendance rate, so it was really rough and I brought Google Classroom to my school. I went to a conference in my, oh god, when was that? 2015. I went to a conference and I saw somebody using Google Classroom and I'm like, this is awesome. I want to do this. And nobody in my school was doing it and they're just like, well, I guess if we can figure it out. So I wanted to find something that could attach to that as well. So I pushed to get the funding to get gizmos at that district and then at MMSD, they pay for it anyway. They already have it, so I didn't have to fight that fight, but I really liked it for students that have attendance issues and being able as a way to introduce topics and to introduce concepts that I wouldn't be able to teach in a lab, so I'm not going to be able to mimic an entire population of squirrels and all this stuff like that and I can do it with this.

Patrick McGee (14:28):

I can do this embryo development piece in the physical science realm. I was doing it with atom builders and building the atoms and seeing how they react and electro negativity and stuff. That's just really hard to teach without college level material and I find it works really good for that. But before, what I was originally using it for was that for every physical lab or thing I was doing in the classroom, I would pair a gizmo with it as a grade recovery task for students with if they were incarcerated for a couple months and they come back, what did I miss? Okay, well let's start with these things or out on maternity leave for a couple of months and then come back. All instances that I've dealt with.

Daylene Long (15:11):

So what I heard was that you use it for kind of a makeup session so that if somebody's been gone for a long time, you use it for that. I heard that you were introduced to it when you were studying to be a teacher. Do you ever use them to replace a lab or do you pair it with hands-on?

Patrick McGee (15:38):

I tend to pair it with hands-on. I have in the past used it to replace labs, so in particular I'm going to replace some population dynamics pieces with it just because I didn't find the argument driven inquiry to be that much better. A lot of it was linking use the computer program, but it was less robust. So I'm just kind of replacing it with that and then kind of changing up some of the questions on the explore learning piece. I see it kind of fitting almost like I used to use FET Labs a lot in the past when I didn't have gizmos because FET lab being free and they're really good. They're just old looking and sometimes don't work very well, but they do the trick too, so I'm going to replace a couple of in-person labs with it, but mostly as a supplement.

Daylene Long (16:36):

Okay. Well let's talk about your hands-on labs. The ones where you've, you've got, they've got the hands-on periods where you're buying different supplies for hands-on labs. Talk to me about the last time you did a purchase for something like that. What was it, who did you buy it from and what was your thought process?

Patrick McGee (17:02):

The largest part was, hold on one moment, my wife calling me, I'm just going to say it was buying a lot of the initial supplies to start this lab up was the biggest purchase that I did that was I think a seven to $8,000 purchase and it was split amongst, it was about $150 on Amazon and I think it ended up being 5,000 through Carolina Biological and about two and a half to three through Flinn. And that was a lot of me trying to figure out what equipment was just the most cost effective across it. We had to pay shipping on it regardless, it doesn't matter. There wasn't really that many discounts or anything that related to that. Most recently I purchased Nutrient Auger and Petri dish plates for a bacterial growing lab just because that's something I couldn't purchase too far in advance. So I tried to kind of buy those to order that was Carolina Biological that I got that stuff and then I'm going to have students making soap and physical science for a ification lab for a chemical reaction lab and that material I bought through Amazon, it was just easier than going to the grocery store.

Daylene Long (18:25):

Yeah, okay. I want to pause for just a second. Yep. So thinking of the Carolina order for a little bit, and then what did you buy from Carolina and do you remember what you bought from Flinn?

Patrick McGee (18:46):

Flinn was big items. Flinn, I believe we got our incubator from Flinn Hot Plates we got from Flinn. We got some scales from Flinn. The larger scales, the smaller scales were actually, I just replaced our smaller scales actually from Amazon. Actually the ones you would use in the kitchen are just as good as what I need 'em for and they're cheaper so they don't need Carolina or Flinn's logo on 'em. Those are things that we bought. I bought half the glassware from Flinn and half from Carolina just simply based on pricing. I, I believe I bought the buns and burners from Carolina and the tubes from Flinn because of price. I have a spreadsheet on my work computer of everything, which is like this is what this costs, this is what this costs here.

Daylene Long (19:36):

Okay. Tell me a little bit about your spreadsheet. You've got the costs on there, so you compare costs between them. Are there other factors in there or is it No, your spreadsheets are straight up looking at Carolina versus Flinn in a spreadsheet for who's expensive

Patrick McGee (19:56):

And Thermo Fisher was in there, but Thermo Fisher is expensive on everything, Thermo Fisher's college stuff, so it's pretty much spreadsheet on that I remember. So I did in my first year of teaching, I was in a founding school. It was Carmen Northwest when they're founded for middle school and they let me buy materials for a curriculum that they did there. They just needed somebody to write up all the list for it and that I did do through Carolina all of it, what they were partnered with for and they did give us discounts and they did give us free swag and stuff for buying everything through Carolina, but I haven't found that relationship with since then with specifically one site doing better for us than another discounting anything. There was no discounted rates, no discounted tripping on anybody no matter how much we bought. So there was no reason to only order through one company.

Daylene Long (20:53):

Okay, so go back, you said that there was somebody you were working with that because of that relationship you got the discounts, the swag. Who was that?

Patrick McGee (21:04):

So the founder of the school's name was Patricia Ho, Dr. Patricia Hoen, and she with the Carmen School that she had in the past, which all the science supplies built a relationship with Carolina Biological. And so

Daylene Long (21:19):

Do you know if it was with a rep or a particular salesperson or if it was the company?

Patrick McGee (21:24):

I don't know. That was in 2013, so I don't exactly remember who that was specifically. But no, when I originally did explore learning and I was kind of the point person buying the explore learning curriculum, I did work with a rep and eventually that rep pretty much stayed with me for a year and a half while I convinced the school to spend really not that much money to get it. So I have worked with reps in the past, but we just don't have one for capital.

Daylene Long (21:57):

Okay. So do you have any sense then why you were getting kind of discounts and swag from Carolina back before and why it's changed?

Patrick McGee (22:08):

No idea. No idea. I actually didn't know that we were going to get a thing and then I looked up later and it's like, oh, you spent over this much money, so we threw in a messenger bag. It's like, okay. Other than that, no. I've been a part of a curriculum adoption committee in 20, was it 2020 and typical curriculum adoption swag of like here's a cup, here's this thing to buy our product, but it was covid year, so we didn't really actually get much. It was all in a central location. It's like you can disinfect and come in here to get it, and we're like, no thanks.

Daylene Long (22:46):

I didn't know that about curriculum adoption committees. They send you swag when they send you materials to review?

Patrick McGee (22:52):

Oh yeah. Usually it's in some kind of messenger bag when they give you the books and it's like, here's this book but this messenger bag and you open it up and here's a T-shirt in there and there's a bunch of junk and it's a lot of the stuff that you would get if you went to an educator conference and started talking to people there in the industry. But that year it wasn't that effective. It was all locked away in a space and you had to covid protocols go in to go get it. It was a remote committee and everything too, so it was a mess.

Daylene Long (23:22):

So you needed a hazmat suit to go in and get

Patrick McGee (23:26):

It based on those policies? Yeah, it was ridiculous. You had to go into their central office and their central offices had different policies and it was small mess, but

Daylene Long (23:35):

So the materials review committees, do they ever review things like technology or LabWare or anything like that?

Patrick McGee (23:46):

Yeah, in this committee we went with, I can't remember what the curriculum was, but it was largely remote and it required curriculum, or sorry, the book was largely digital, not remote, and so the book was largely digital. There were workbooks that you could have it synced with Google Classroom and there were specific lab pieces required, so we would have to review and be like, will all of the biology classes across the district actually purchase this many beakers and this many things and have access to these kinds of supplies? So that was in our thought process with that. We thought it aligned with the NGSS better than anything else though. So we went with it and then we were like, we're hoping everybody does it and so far, I know I left Madison right or Milwaukee after that. I believe they're doing fine with it. I never got to actually teach with it sadly. But

Daylene Long (24:48):

Are there any of the vendors that you consider yourself, they're your go-to vendor or you feel loyal to them or anything like that?

Patrick McGee (24:58):

I think if I had to pick a vendor to be loyal to it probably would be Carolina Biological. And then as far as book vendors, no, I don't really use textbooks hardly ever. It's impossible to check 'em out to kids and the things that I use is just whatever digital resources available.

Daylene Long (25:21):

What makes you feel loyal to an organization like Carolina bought Biological or any other one? What are kind of the hooks for you

Patrick McGee (25:32):

Reliably? They have the cheaper prices. That's why a majority of the order was from Carolina. They also, in my experience, they're kind of off the shelf labs of blood typing lab and the micro electrolysis kit that I actually just recently used from them, they have pretty decent teaching materials, materialism. I adapted the micro electrolysis thing to kind of fit what I wanted it to do, but if I had to print it and give it to the kids, write out the book and I had no time, it probably would've been pretty effective too. And I know their blood typing labs got a similar kit. I know they have their catalyst lab to show yeast respiration and stuff like that. That's a pretty good one that I've seen before. Usually their microscope slides come with some kind of a kit and some kind of resource involved with it too. Their resources in that end and their kits are usually better. So I've been talking more and more to new teachers now that I've been in for a decade and they probably would be what I'd recommend just for the money. You could use the resources out the gate, especially if you're new.

Daylene Long (26:49):

Okay, so you can use the resources out just when you're new start. You mentioned that they were reliably lower priced and how is their reliability in general and what do you roll into that notion of reliability?

Patrick McGee (27:10):

The stuff that I get isn't broken and it works and it's cheaper than usually Fisher or Flinn or Thermo Fisher for sure. And so I just kind of gravitate to that. It doesn't have to, what was I trying to say here? I wouldn't say that with science supplies there's really not a quality difference. Like a Pyrex speaker is a Pyrex speaker for the most part. Some of are a little thicker and thinner, but for the most part their stuff's all reliable. I can do that and if I broke it, then I know that I could buy a replacement for slightly cheaper than the other place.

Daylene Long (27:56):

Yeah, that makes sense. Were you also introduced to Carolina or Flinn when you were studying to become a teacher, become a psych? No,

Patrick McGee (28:06):

No. I actually, I didn't really know what supplied what and the high school that I went to, God, everything was so old there that I don't think it even had a logo on it still. And in college they didn't really tell us what anything came from. You get your goggles from the UIC bookstore and that was it.

Daylene Long (28:28):

Okay, well that's interesting.

Patrick McGee (28:31):

Yeah, I just was like, I went in and was told these are the vendors, three big ones and you can get stuff from Amazon and stopped. I didn't get Amazon stuff as much because it was such a pain when I first started teaching to approve Amazon as a vendor and it still is kind of even with donors choose to be like, yeah, we could donors choose but don't do Amazon. It's like why? And they're like, because it's not an education vendor. And I'm like, but it's cheaper. Anyway, so it became the Carolina has the mostly reliable one that I just,

Daylene Long (29:04):

Is it the districts who said don't use Amazon because they're not an educational vendor

Patrick McGee (29:10):

And it was all for legal reasons of spending the money. You got to use the school funds on education vendors. And Amazon at the time wasn't that, so I had to spend $40 more on a pack of test tubes because they're like, don't order it through Amazon. And I'm like, that's insane. Can I get this poster? How much is it? And I'm like, $4 on Amazon. They're like, I can't do that. I'm like, okay, it's 14 on Carolina. And they're like, all right. I was like, whatever. So it's kind of ridiculousness that's cleared up now. Amazon's approved now in a lot of places. Thankfully it's done through Amazon business now. They use it as a business expense at the school that I'm at. I can get posters and I have a 3D printer now there, so I get 3D filaments and stuff like that. And don't use education vendors on the filament. They charge you twice as much for the same thing

Daylene Long (30:09):

Through for the Amazon, do you go through your principal or through the district or how does that work?

Patrick McGee (30:18):

For the most part, if the order is under a certain amount, it can just stay within the school. I think if it's over two grand, the district has to get involved and at the end of the day, if the school's budget doesn't match what they're actually allocated, then there someone's had goes on a block. So we kind of just keep track of it. So I have a two grand budget this year for science, and you just keep track of it on a spreadsheet of what I've spent to what, and that's about it. They would rather you not spend more than I think $200 at a time on Amazon is what I was told.

Daylene Long (30:57):

But in general, for a school year, you've got about 2000 to spend and you allocated that across different companies according to what you need. Yeah. Okay. And then you mentioned that, let's see, we talked about the bigger purchase that you made. I also would like to kind of know, we talked about this idea of being an education vendor. What other kinds of things when you're doing labs, when you're buying supplies, can vendors do to make your life better or students' lives better? We know that you are always doing more with less, and so we're kind of looking into what else do teachers need? How else can we help them?

Patrick McGee (31:46):

So for me in particular, I don't really think of anything because I'm more designing my labs to what it is and then buying the materials that I need from whatever vendor. And it doesn't really matter, but thinking of new teachers, it would be really nice to how Carolina has those pre-made labs and have some pre-made materials. That's good. I've also bought posters and they're like comes with worksheets and I looked at 'em and they're crap. But a decent lab, something that's written that's going to challenge the kids to make an argument based on this data that they're collecting and not just run a cookie cutter lab, something that's going to align automatically out the gate to the NG, putting it onto the package. Considering a lot of districts have gone to nng SS, that's kind of I think the more popular science one now. So start putting it on almost like on the box, this does HS LS two dash five and you're like, sweet, that's what I'm doing.

Patrick McGee (32:57):

And then you can just grab the thing and do it. I think that would be really useful. It just saves a little bit of the busy work with that. I also would like it if the materials were digitally available and it would be awesome if any materials that came with the stuff maybe have a download code and it wasn't just a PDF, it would be awesome if that was a Word document or a Google document, even if it's watermarked or something to prevent recopying and reposting on the internet and that that's illegal. It you, it's watermarked, right? I'm fine with that. It's just I use Google Classroom so much and if I have something in A PDF, I have to hand retype it unless I use that PDF transfer software and then I have to go and fix it anyway. And I've just gotten to the point where I just typed faster and do it that way. So I think would be really just saving little bits of time here and there just kind of cutting some of the waste.

Daylene Long (33:56):

And my assumption is you want it as a word or Google doc because you want to customize it or can you say a little bit more about why you want it that way?

Patrick McGee (34:07):

So words, word documents. I can convert to Google Docs and put on Google Classroom to be completed. Google Docs automatically do that. PDFs, they have to download Lumen. If it's a fillable PDF, I have to teach 'em how to use it. Half the times those don't save properly and most schools are switched to Chromebooks anyway, so they struggle with doing fillable PDFs on those Chromebooks, some of them.

Daylene Long (34:32):

Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Let's see. Are there any lab kits out there that you wish somebody had put together that you haven't seen?

Patrick McGee (34:48):

I wish there was a better, so I just recently did a fireworks flame test.

Daylene Long (34:57):

Oh yeah,

Patrick McGee (34:58):

Neat. Yeah, it's awesome. I love it. Love doing it with the kids and I wish that there was a better version of that. There's some that exist where they'll sell you the liquid or they'll sell you the powder to flame test and they ask you to like, oh, get an inoculating loop or a platinum wire or a stainless, because depending on the wire, it burns different colors and screws it up. And so what I did was I made solutions pretty high molar solutions of the salts, the metal salts and soaked them in coffee stirs until those got soaked full and then used those to light or soaked the coffee stir and dipped it into the salt itself and then light those into it because then I'm not having 'em deal with a hot metal thing that they have to quench and then those corrode really fast when you're burning salts on 'em.

Patrick McGee (35:57):

And so I wish there was something out the gate like that where you could just buy the set and almost like they do, I forget which company has it, but they have antibiotic test for bacteria and they'll sell you basically the Petri dish, the liquid to inoculate the entire Petri dish and then the antibiotics on discs that you just put onto it and then you can see the area and what's affected by that. But I don't have to soak those little cotton swabs and antibiotic either. They're already there. I wish they had something like that where it was just like, here, these sticks, it's enough for 10 groups of four and there's all the different colors and you just have 'em expose 'em to it and record down in this data rather than trying to deal with the chemicals. Some of 'em are toxic, it's a mess. It would be really nice to do it that way.

Daylene Long (36:48):

So it's lab prep time as well as safety issues, just having other materials to maybe make it a richer experience. What about, do any of the vendors you work with have videos either for the students to watch before they do a lab or do they have any training videos for teachers? Because you do a lab once a year, so you kind of have to refresh your memory. Do you know of anybody that's doing that?

Patrick McGee (37:22):

Some do. There's some. It's hit or miss with those. A lot of the times I just would rather do the reading with what I got in front of me and then trying to mimic it because the students are going to have to try to do that too. So if I'm trying to sit there and do it and go like, I can't do this without a video, then the students definitely can't do it without a demonstration. So to try to help 'em that way. So I often don't look at those, but that wouldn't be a bad idea to have with more difficult apparatus to have. This is how you set them up, the electrolysis apparatus. I ended up having to set that up for a lot of students, but I think if I had a minute or two video to show them how to do it, they probably could have done it themselves. So that might be, yeah, that one didn't have a video that electrolysis one, but that would be kind of useful. Yeah, I could see useful in that.

Daylene Long (38:28):

Okay. Let's see, what else. I think before I ask to join us, I wanted to see is there anything else that a vendor could do to make your job easier or to make learning better for students?

Patrick McGee (38:50):

I don't know. I think just again, having, if there's, they're going to provide worksheets and stuff, have it in a format that's more usable, just the PDF to run off on the copier, that's not 21st century anymore. We're not just making copies of worksheets as much anymore. And I think that'd be nice as little setups steps as you can do would be nice. Not saying everything needs to go in a little dropper bottles right out the gate. You can big bottle of stuff and then I could put it in dropper bottles, that's fine too. But less mixing maybe would be nice in certain labs, especially ones where they might produce some kind of a fume. A lot of the new high schools aren't getting fume hoods. They set up my lab and they gave me bumps and burners and I don't have a fume hood and it's bizarre. I'm not a huge fan of it. I am fighting to get a flame blanket and so I have plenty of fire extinguishers, which is nice, and a safety shower and I wash stations, but just no fume hood. So I think fume hoods are starting to become a really big expense that's not being done as much

Daylene Long (40:07):

They required by osha.

Patrick McGee (40:10):

I don't think labs that are requiring fume hoods

Patrick McGee (40:20):

Are falling out of favor because of the money. And then also the lack of science teachers. So the amount of science teachers that would want to use the fume hoods are more experienced. And I am one of a few in Madison that have 10 years of experience under the belt. A lot of new science teachers if there are any, and there's still science vacancies in this district and in Milwaukee. So the amount of student people that are going to be even wanting to use a fume hood with a class of 40 and things that are going kind of crazy in their room, I don't know if they're going to want to care about that, but I've only ever worked in one school that's had a fume hood in four schools that I've been in, so

Daylene Long (41:03):

Okay. I did have another thought. Do you know either at the school level or at the district level, if your science funds get any supplementation from CTE?

Patrick McGee (41:16):

No. If you want to access that, you usually have to do a project lead the WAY program in your school. We've considered it at my school. The only problem is that with only one science teacher, I have to teach just the course. So we can't really do ACTE. We've considered going towards more like a medical pathway with CTE and that would get supplemented by exterior funds. So if I needed dissection pieces or things for a healthcare pathway, that would be a different funding than the science funding. And I know that that's how it's done in other schools with their anatomy program as a part of their healthcare pathway, which is CTE, then therefore that comes out of CTE funds,

Daylene Long (42:03):

But it doesn't necessarily have to be Project Lead the way. It can be a healthcare pathway.

Patrick McGee (42:09):

They code 'em as project lead, the Wake horses pretty much for all of 'em. They kind of just, yeah,

Daylene Long (42:15):

But it's not through Project Lead the Way. They just code it.

Patrick McGee (42:21):

I don't think they're using it correctly. I've been at a school that had legitimate project Lead the Way with a lot of their resources and that was coded differently, but they used it in cooperation with their engineering and electrician pathways that they had. So the Project Lead the Way was their physics course and it was weird how they were connected, but I think it's just a way to be like, Hey, we offer Project Lead the Way courses.

Daylene Long (42:52):

One other thing I keep thinking of before I bring Kim in, you mentioned that you'd like to see the standard printed on the box that a kit comes in. You're actually the first person I've heard say that heard is how else would you find out what standards something is connected to and why would you want it on the box?

Patrick McGee (43:19):

I think it makes it easier for new teachers coming into the standards. They're complicated. The NGSS standards are more complicated than Common Core, and I've studied both and they just are. They're more higher scientific language, they are more complicated. So if you were going to have somebody like a long-term sub or a principal trying to order things for a science teacher coming in without a science background, it is complicated to know what kind of things that you're going to try to get without knowing that. So if you know that you're teaching these six standards, you picked them in a committee or the district has a scope and sequence, but you just have that and see standards, you can kind of pull it off to be like, Hey, this is a thing. Almost kind of knowing what genre of music that you're going to go get if you go into a music store, which doesn't exist anymore, but I'm going to go to the rock section here, smile or the Rock. So I think that would be useful There also, schools are moving more towards standards-based grading as opposed to just kind of like you get your grade based on just the test or your finals at the end and stuff like that. So the district, the school I'm in is now moving towards standards based and it's been a really hard path upwards to that, but to having the standard kind of there just goes like, okay, this lab is for this standard, almost kind of as a reminder and a push towards that better pedagogical stance.

Daylene Long (44:55):

Okay. Do your standards-based grading, do they only test on the disciplinary core ideas in science or did they also test on cross-cutting concepts in science and engineering practices?

Patrick McGee (45:09):

In ours, the way we're doing it this year, and it's kind of different at a competency-based school, well competency I'm putting in air quotes, not truly a competency, but anyway, we have our competencies, which is our standards, and then we have four success criteria, almost kind of like a flexible rubric being like if they can show me that they know the characteristics of life, the parts that make up the cell these things, and I have 'em better written at school, then they get points towards showing proficiency in that standard, which is the competency which we're switching from showing competency in the success criteria to proficiency in the standard buzzword buzzword. So that's kind of what we're doing with it now. And MPS, when I was teaching standards-based grading there, it was showing three pieces of evidence that hit the standard within the disciplinary core ideas that you're teaching for that current unit that you're doing. So we kind of looked more at those. I know the Nng SS has a cells in its function and then there's multiple standards within that kind of umbrella. And that umbrella would be my unit and then all the standards under it that I choose to teach would be the standards that are hitting that unit, and then we'd move on to the next unit kind of thing was how it was developed there.

Daylene Long (46:39):

Okay, that makes sense. We're getting close to the end of our time and I want to be respectful of your schedule. Kim, did you have any follow-up questions?

Kimberly Herder (46:50):

I did have one, but you don't have to spend a lot of time on it. You were talking about whether it was at a previous school attendance and keeping kids up to or systems. Do you have or do you use a kit base when you have a few kids who are behind and how do you get them back up and what, is there a product you use or could use to do that?

Patrick McGee (47:18):

So originally I would keep notes as I used to do them as a modified flip where students would take notes off of the video. I would record, I used Screencastify at the time to record video lectures and put them online. That was really useful during the pandemic. So they would have that and we would use Explore Learning to do the labs to catch those up. At the time that I started that we originally were forced to use Achieve 3000 for reading and forced is the word I would use for that. And I would assign readings that were the closest to the standards that were also there to teach them the things. But now I've switched to using new ELA and each unit has about three to four article readings in there with questions that I design that are also attached as recovery assignments as well as kind of exploring them into it is. So for example, I did one that was about the states of matter and then an article that was a follow-up that was about a group of scientists that got a molecule down to the coldest that they've ever gotten it and how it interacts at this really cold temperature. What was

Daylene Long (48:33):

That resource again? What was the name of that that you used with the articles?

Patrick McGee (48:37):

News? ELA or I guess some people call it Newsela.

Daylene Long (48:41):

Okay, got it.

Patrick McGee (48:43):

I don't know which pronunciation's right, but we have that for the district resource and honestly I have students that read at 200 Lexile and at a 1500 in the same class. So I will print out the articles at five different levels and have students be able to pick based on their lexile, which is why I really gravitate towards new EA because the articles are relevant and and a lot better. And then also at about five really big Lexile levels. So that's another thing that I use to kind of repair missing class time. So readings on new ELA or achieve 3000 digital lectures with questions and explore learning gizmos.

Daylene Long (49:32):

Is there anything else as we wrap this up that you would like us to know?

Patrick McGee (49:38):

Not so much. I mean, I think I've kind of talked about most of the stuff in here. I just think that as much as new teachers can be helped with trying to push students in through inquiry and doing that creative thinking with whatever vendor materials are given to them, the better off they'll be as teachers and the students will be better off with their thinking too.

Daylene Long (50:01):

So really, really exposing new teachers to the different materials and ways of Yeah, that makes sense. Kim, do you want to wrap up with next steps?

Kimberly Herder (50:14):

Patrick, I'm going to send you an email tomorrow now and that we'll have, we had posted at Amazon, but it's a Visa gift card if that's okay with you.

Patrick McGee (50:25):

Okay, works good. Yeah.

Kimberly Herder (50:26):

Alright. And in that I'm also going to include a place that you can get ahold of Daylene directly of anything that we haven't covered or that you think of that would be useful or continue the conversation or even start up another branch of a conversation for looking at life science tools in the classroom.

Patrick McGee (50:50):

Awesome.

Daylene Long (50:52):

And if you'd like, we do interviews and focus groups and surveys, several of 'em a year. So if you're interested in being involved in other ones, just in your email, just kind of reply and let us know so that we know that you're kind of interested in providing feedback on behalf of teachers.

Patrick McGee (51:12):

Yep. Yeah, I like doing these, so thank you.

Daylene Long (51:15):

Yep, absolutely. Well, thank you again for your time. We really appreciate it and thank you for everything that you do for our students and for other science teachers. We really appreciate it.

Kimberly Herder (51:30):

Thank you. Did you want to reveal who is doing this?

Daylene Long (51:34):

I was going to wait and see if he asked, but Oh,

Kimberly Herder (51:36):

Okay.

Daylene Long (51:38):

We're doing this on behalf of Carolina.

Patrick McGee (51:41):

I don't have Cool.

Daylene Long (51:42):

Yeah, they really want to be able to provide for teachers and for students and see what's missing. Things have changed a lot post pandemic, so just kind of keep that in the back of your mind and if you come up with anything, please, please do send us an email. So

Patrick McGee (52:00):

Cool. Glad.

Kimberly Herder (52:02):

Yeah, if you do want some swag or something, we don't probably have any poll, but

Patrick McGee (52:08):

Yeah, I'm glad that they're thinking of revising and making their curriculum and stuff better because yeah, I mean, I think I thought they were already doing, they were above, they were the best ones of the groups that I've worked on so far. So the fact that they're still wanting to make that better is good.

Daylene Long (52:24):

Okay, great. Really good. Thank you so much.

Patrick McGee (52:27):

Yep, thank you. Have a good one. Bye. Bye.

Daylene Long (52:33):

Do you want to stand for a minute? Yep. Okay, so I'm going to press end on this recording.

Daylene Long (00:02):

We are only recording it for note taking purposes. I promise that you won't end up on YouTube and I'm not going to ask you to do a TikTok dance or anything like that. It's just straight up so I don't have to remember all the little details. Let's see. So our goal today is to really kind of understand your experience in getting materials for life science classrooms, what you guys need, what your priorities are. And our client is really wanting to just look for opportunities to make it better for teachers, to make it better for students. So you'll see us ask a lot of why and what questions because we're trying to get at what really frustrates you, what really delights you, and those kinds of things.

Teresa Massey (00:57):

There aren't any right or wrong answers

Daylene Long (01:00):

And some people think it helps to pretend that Kim and I are kind of filming a documentary because we'll ask a lot of details and you'll think, why do they need to know that? But we're trying to get the whole picture and we're trying to really focus too in on the emotions behind things. And at the end there'll be a spot for you to think into what's missing out there that you would love to see be available either for teachers or for students.

Teresa Massey (01:33):

Okay. That's

Daylene Long (01:33):

Our overview. Let's see. Remind me, are you a science department chairperson?

Teresa Massey (01:41):

Yes.

Daylene Long (01:42):

Okay. And what classes do you teach?

Teresa Massey (01:45):

I teach environmental and biology.

Daylene Long (01:48):

Okay, and AP or just the introductory?

Teresa Massey (01:55):

Well, I teach all three AP environmental, I mean Apes and AP Bio and regular both classes, but right now this term we have four terms. This term we're not teaching an AP class. I'm teaching just the regular environmental at this particular term.

Daylene Long (02:16):

Okay, sounds good. So I want to have you think back to that last time that you did go in and buy materials for the life sciences and tell me about the first time that you were like, okay, I need to place an order. I need to get whatever it is, fill in the blank.

Teresa Massey (02:38):

Okay, so I buy, I'm the one that even though I may not teach all the classes, I buy this, I mean I not buy, it's not out of my pocket, but I'm saying I order all the supplies for the department.

Daylene Long (02:51):

And

Teresa Massey (02:52):

So when I'm thinking about life science in environmental science, I kind of think about just being able to have enough for the students, for all the students and many times it is something that they can manipulate, but that we would be able to get the most for our money. So something that we use up

Daylene Long (03:14):

Is not as good as something that we can use over, So something they can manipulate in a hands-on way in a

Teresa Massey (03:25):

Computer

Daylene Long (03:26):

Way. How do you like those things to work together?

Teresa Massey (03:31):

I really prefer something that they can manipulate and we used to call it a lab. It doesn't have to be a lab, but something where the students can be placed in small groups so that they would be able to touch and be able to make the connections in their learning. So when they're learning the content, but how can they connect it so it could even be some type of application of what they're learning.

Daylene Long (03:59):

Okay. And what kind of group sizes do you typically try to aim for? I

Teresa Massey (04:05):

Pretty much want maybe three, sometimes pairs. It depends on the activity. It could be four, but never more than four.

Daylene Long (04:16):

Okay, that sounds good. Okay. So do you purchase once a year, twice a year, all year long? What does the timing look like for you?

Teresa Massey (04:30):

Well, our timing is never the same from year to year it has to do with funding. So many times we will get funding and all of a sudden it's like, you got funding, hurry up and spend it, which I do not like, but because it's like you just out here just grabbing whatever you can grab, but when I know that the money is there and I know it ahead of time, then that usually may happen. Like I say, it is never the same. This year we have not received any money. The money is supposed to come sometime in January, so we have not received any money to be able to spend anything for The

Daylene Long (05:14):

20 23 24 school year, right?

Teresa Massey (05:17):

Yes.

Daylene Long (05:19):

Okay.

Teresa Massey (05:21):

In a way, we kind of spend the money at the end of the school year. This past year we decided on what we were going to purchase and then we purchased it for this year. And so the things that we purchased though were more of computer-based. I guess it would be more software type things. Do

Daylene Long (05:45):

You remember what you bought in terms of software

Teresa Massey (05:48):

We bought? When you said that my brain is just going, we bought a software for reading literacy, read theory software. We bought, gosh, Do you remember what

Daylene Long (06:06):

You got? Science

Teresa Massey (06:08):

Didn't buy it. We did not. Well, we, we have STEM scopes and the district bought that for us. I mean, that's not something that we purchased, but we were part of the STEM scopes. Like I said, this past year, a lot of our money that we had ahead of time was really for whole school. So when you're thinking about science, no, we did not spend any money yet on science that will come in January.

Daylene Long (06:35):

Okay. STEM scopes for a second. So that's something that you guys get year over year, is that correct?

Teresa Massey (06:44):

Right, the district.

Daylene Long (06:46):

Okay. Is it new to the school or have you been using it for a while?

Teresa Massey (06:51):

We use it for a while. It's not new to the school, no.

Daylene Long (06:55):

Okay. Do they provide any professional development with that?

Teresa Massey (07:00):

Initially they provided professional development, but it's not a every year professional development, so as we get new teachers, there's no professional development. It was just when they initially decided to go with it. Then I guess as far as I know, we had training, but no one has offered any training from the district level since that initial training.

Daylene Long (07:27):

So you get a new teacher in and they're expected to use STEM scopes. How do they come up to speed then?

Teresa Massey (07:35):

They really don't. The only way that they come up to speed is based on say myself as a department chair or another teacher or they kind of muddle through it on their own. They also offer support where you can send a message or ask a question, but not any real training.

Daylene Long (07:56):

Okay. Do they have any videos or any community forms or anything?

Teresa Massey (08:02):

Yes.

Daylene Long (08:03):

Okay.

Teresa Massey (08:04):

But it, it's still not the same as if you had someone that came because one of the things, well, you didn't ask me that, so nevermind. No, go ahead. I

Daylene Long (08:14):

Want to hear It. I was going to say, sometimes there's a lot of different things that we get

Teresa Massey (08:19):

And so when you get something, we become so there's so much that you don't end up using it because you have so many different things and if you don't get the training on it, then you really aren't using it. It's just like, okay, I have it, but you just don't use it because it's too time consuming to try to figure it out.

Daylene Long (08:39):

Yeah, that makes sense. Let's see. Okay, so you typically decide what you want at the end of a school year, may, June, is that

Teresa Massey (08:53):

That's the way it's been? It would be like April, may because we actually get out of school and here we get out of school. Right. Usually before Labor Day, so I'm sorry, Memorial Day.

Daylene Long (09:06):

And

Teresa Massey (09:06):

So generally we've already made those decisions somewhere around April

Daylene Long (09:15):

And then you put in an order for it and hope to have it for the next school year?

Teresa Massey (09:21):

Yes. When school starts, we have it. Do you

Daylene Long (09:23):

Guys have material review committees or is it just up to you as a department chair to decide and by talking to the teachers or how does that work?

Teresa Massey (09:34):

Okay. We're a pretty big district, so on the district level we do have review of materials when the district is buying purchasing, and I've been generally on those committees for years. It's also tech for the textbook, those type things. And so when it comes to funding that we may have on the school level, then it's basically would be me or others looking at it through the department. So if someone contact me or if I reached out to someone or if a teacher asked me to check into something and then what we would do is we would look at it together and make a decision to see if it was something that we wanted.

Daylene Long (10:15):

Okay. How did the districts decide who to pull together for a materials review if they're doing it at the district level?

Teresa Massey (10:25):

Well, generally, for instance, we have science coordinators and so they've kind of pulled the same people that they know. If you know the science coordinator, they just kind of pull people. So I've worked along with the science coordinators because I've been in the district for a long time, so I've been on several review committees and I also have helped write curriculum for the district. So sometimes it's just the people that they know that they feel that, hey, come and help us. So it's, that's probably the best way to say it. It's like people that they know in the district that can support them

Daylene Long (11:05):

Help me understand the process. It's always been kind of a mis mystery to me, and every district does it differently, so that's probably part of the reason it's a mystery to me.

Teresa Massey (11:13):

But

Daylene Long (11:13):

Did they give you a rubric or a guide or anything like that? What does the process look like?

Teresa Massey (11:22):

Well, generally we do have a rubric. There's a rubric and we are deciding on what we're going to purchase. And many times they like to go with, and I guess maybe based on the package that's being sold, sometimes the textbooks companies sell several things within the package and so there's a rubric that breaks down whatever they're looking for, whatever we're looking for. And we get points.

Daylene Long (11:52):

And so

Teresa Massey (11:52):

Usually will have more than one vendor selling something, so it might be at least three vendors. And then I believe that based on the purchasing, they can't just go with one vendor, they actually have to have several to look at. And then we give points and pretty much it's pretty much how we decide. Of course it has to go up to the board and they have to actually vote, but they don't really make decisions on the content because that's not something that they know. So the board's making decisions then on the budget

Daylene Long (12:30):

For it, I would probably say more of the budget. They have to have the final say,

Teresa Massey (12:36):

But within the budget, and once the budget is approved for say large materials like big purchase orders, then from there they give the task to the committees. And sometimes you actually have a person that's over the science people that actually handles ordering the big, especially textbooks and all of those type things. And they task the science coordinators to help bring people in to be able to review the materials. And we have rubrics for that. And then from there, whatever we ask for or we come to a conclusion, then that goes then into the board for their final approval.

Daylene Long (13:22):

That person that's over it, is it more of a procurement person or a chief academic officer, or what kind of focus do they have?

Teresa Massey (13:32):

In the past it's been a, it's not really, I don't know. I mean they change titles all the time, but it would be, wouldn't necessarily be a person that's in procurement, but it is someone that's over purchasing of textbooks and a lot of these other things come underneath that, some of the software and some of that comes underneath that. Okay, That's

Daylene Long (13:56):

Helpful. I want to tell you about a situation that I ran into with something and I wondered if it was common across material review committees. I talked to a teacher who had been reviewing it was actually promotional material for a new product, and he said to me, if I was on a materials review committee, I would've tossed that out immediately. And I said, why? And he said, well, you've got two pictures on there with gender stereotypes. You've got a young woman who's doing cooking science and you have a young man who's skateboarding. He said, in my district, that wouldn't fly at all. We would toss it out immediately. And I wondered if there was a rubric for, or if it was just an understanding of the, I wonder what flexibility you guys have within the rubric to make those kinds of judgements and better in alignment with your district

Teresa Massey (15:06):

Going in alignment with the district or whatever. Our superintendent and the board, and right now, a lot of things are changing, so everything is changing, so it's not anything set in stone, but we are always looking to have diversity and to be able to support all the learners. And so I know that in many of the textbooks or many of the materials, you want to see people that look like or where the students can identify with. Now, when it comes to some of these sensitive issues that have come up in the last couple years, that's like a changing target that changes all the time. But it is a consideration because you have parents that also, I didn't say that they get chance to look at the materials

Daylene Long (16:03):

And so

Teresa Massey (16:04):

Yeah, parents in community, not just parents but community are able to come in and look at the material. So you may have people that are part of the community that don't even have students that are in the school system that may bring something up that may be like myself or you may not notice, but it may be something that resonates with them.

Daylene Long (16:29):

For these kinds of processes, is it for orders over a certain size, is it over a thousand, 5,000, 10,000? Do you guys have a district level for that where it has to go through these steps?

Teresa Massey (16:48):

Right. Well, generally, and I can't really say the exact at this point, the exact dollar amount. When we order something, if it's over $4,000, we have to, there's a few extra steps that we have to do. I'm sorry, over $5,000. There's a few steps that we have to do. And once again, that changes from time to time is to what you need to do. Sometimes it might be you have to get more than one quote if you're going to purchase something that's over that amount. So it really varies based on what is being purchased on the school level. Of course, we're not purchasing like the district, so we have a little bit more leeway in using our funds.

Daylene Long (17:39):

You do you have a list of approved vendors at your level, at the science department chair level? Right. The district has approved vendors. So if it's something that I want to purchase

Teresa Massey (17:54):

And it requires a purchase order, if it's not approved, if the district does not have them approved, then they have to go through the approval process.

Daylene Long (18:05):

And as a science department chairperson, are there any extra things that vendors put in proposals that are really helpful for you besides just the basics of what you asked for? Is there anything that you see them include that kind of triggers it? Oh, that's good. They're moving up on my list.

Teresa Massey (18:30):

Well, I like resources that are relevant and that especially some type of software or something that you say you're purchasing it and it's something that you would like to be able to use for a few years, even though it might be some type of subscription or something that you may pay yearly. If what's happening in the world is changing, you would like the material to change. So if it's something that you would get information through, I guess an online, I don't know if that's the right word, an online where I'm going to go into a database or something, I want to make sure that that information is constantly being updated. That's important. Updated information. I mean, we have some textbooks update the online textbook, for instance. Some of them do that and others, you get the hard copy classroom. Right now we only buy classroom sets and a lot of the software is able to access it through and online platform. So you just want the information not to just be stagnant. You want it to be able to update and if you're looking for current information and current events, you want it to be able to be part of what the students are learning.

Daylene Long (19:52):

Okay. And what about hands-on labs?

Teresa Massey (19:55):

What kind of things do you do in your life

Daylene Long (19:57):

Science courses for hands-on activities?

Teresa Massey (20:03):

Well, a lot of things are based on phenomena, so the hands-on activities. It is kind of like twofold. We use, our district pretty much uses the five E lesson model, and so within that five engaged part, you're doing some type of phenomenon. So it could be something that the students can manipulate. It could be something that just really a phenomenon based type thing. And that is what really would be, is helpful to teachers to be able to have some type of something that would fit our standards that's phenomenon so that the students engages them. And then from that engagement, then you can teach your lesson, but at the same time, then later if you're doing a lab activity that's an application or a lab activity connect, then that would be the second type of hands-on type or something that students could manipulate. So it could actually be, I mean honestly and truly don't really like kits because to me it's just like the cookbook, but it has to be something that's more inquiry where the students are being able to be part of it, not like, okay, follow follow these steps. So if the kit or if the material that's within a kit allows for students to be able to expand their learning, then that's good. But if it's just, okay, here, take this, take. That to me is too cookbook ish and I don't like, I personally don't use those. I would take maybe some of those materials and then I change it around and adapt it more to a standard space five E science phenomenon type lesson.

Daylene Long (21:55):

Yeah, that makes sense. Does your school require, is there science testing in before they graduate? Did they have to pass a test before they graduate? In science?

Teresa Massey (22:10):

Yes. We have a EOC in science. Well, and for high school it's a biology

Daylene Long (22:19):

And they take that in their senior year.

Teresa Massey (22:21):

Well, not necessarily, it's depending on when they take biology. Some schools take biology in their sophomore year. Some schools may do biology in their freshman year. It just depends. Some schools have a little bit of a leeway, but because some students, they found that they could do better in biology and they were more mature if they took it in 10th grade as opposed to taking it in ninth grade because of the concepts that they would be a little bit immature and not really preparing. So it just depends on the school. Our district has a little bit of leeway as to when you're offered. Usually by the time they get to 12th grade, they've already taken that class.

Daylene Long (23:11):

Okay. That test, you called it an EOC, Is that right? It's the end of the course. Okay.

Teresa Massey (23:20):

Yes.

Daylene Long (23:20):

And then is there, there's the switch within GSS to more of three-dimensional learning, dimensional learning. Did those tests have any component to them that are more open-ended on the phenomenon, meaning not just multiple choice and drag and drop, but something that's tests the three-dimensional learning?

Teresa Massey (23:50):

Well, currently those tests are, they're standards base and just for instance, we've just recently gave those and the students can only do it. I mean, they do it in 90 minutes, 60 to 90 minutes. Most of them are multiple choice, and there may be, it's not something where it's really left for someone to have to really do a lot of extra grading. So I would say it's more of a, if you're looking at DOK, it's definitely not extended thinking because there's not enough time for them to do that. In that little bit of time. It might be some level three, level two, three type questions where they're having to think, use their thinking to process what they know. So it is no longer of course that recall, but they're having to process the information that they know. So sometimes it could include some type of graph, it could include some type of, I guess it would be some type of picture, that's not the right word, but some type of diagram or something. It could be something like that. And then it would be multiple choice questions as well.

Daylene Long (25:09):

But it helps them to kind of process, have they been learning about data analysis? Have they been learning about process and things like that?

Teresa Massey (25:20):

These tests require them to make connections, and so if they're just, we find that if the students come to school and if they are able to be able to take those, for instance, biology, it each has standards and in the way it's been broken down, the teachers are pretty much teaching what is in those standards. And let's see, somebody just came in my door, the custodian threw me off. So they're teaching the standards, and through those standards, the standards are pretty clear. So we kind of unpack the standard to make sure that the teachers are teaching what's needed so that they can be prepared for the test. And so what's needed is having some type of manipulatives or some type of, when I say manipulatives, some type of hands-on activity or something that they could do to connect their learning for those standards,

Daylene Long (26:15):

If that Makes

Teresa Massey (26:16):

Sense.

Daylene Long (26:17):

Do anything, do you do any hands-on labs using either live specimens or specimens for dissection?

Teresa Massey (26:25):

Pretty much our standards have pretty much taking dissections out in live specimens. There's not really any, I mean, you could use plants, there's things that you could use, but definitely no dissections. There's nothing there for dissections. There may be something, of course in anatomy and physiology where if someone was doing a comparative type anatomy, but that's humans, so usually, usually we are not doing it. We have lots of specimens for dissection, just sitting in the storage room right now.

Daylene Long (27:12):

Okay. Has that been a recent shift then if you've got specimens sitting in a storage room?

Teresa Massey (27:17):

No, it's been, I mean, since we have adopted the standards that we've had, and we've had these for many years, well, I didn't say many years, I guess since about 20, I can't even remember, but we've, this is not something new. I think we've had these standards maybe at least since 20 12, 20 10, somewhere around for a while. Yeah. Okay. That

Daylene Long (27:46):

Makes sense. What about live specimens for things like life cycles or some of the butterfly and moth kinds of things or anything like That?

Teresa Massey (27:57):

No. It would be fine to use anything like that because many of those can be applications and you can look at how you apply for students to be able to do so. Yes, even with plants and those type things? Yes.

Daylene Long (28:14):

And where would you typically buy those kinds of kits or specimens or just supplies?

Teresa Massey (28:21):

Well, some companies sell the kits and then they provide a coupon, I guess is what it would be, that you would just let them know, Hey, this, I want to get this. And then they send it to you because they generally, and then sometimes for plants, I just would go to a Home Depot and just buy them. There's some things that we do have some funding year to year that we can turn in to get reimbursed for certain things.

Daylene Long (28:52):

Okay. The company that you said gives you kind of a coupon and then you get it, do you remember the name of that company?

Teresa Massey (28:59):

Several of them buy Carolina.

Daylene Long (29:03):

Okay.

Teresa Massey (29:04):

I mean, we buy a lot from when we're buying those types things we buy from Carolina. But yes, most of those companies, when they sell kits, if it's something that requires you to some type of specimen or something, they do provide the opportunity for you to, if you bought the kit, if I got the kit because the school system was buying every school, this particular kit, and I'm not getting ready to teach this and it comes in the summer, then I would just use that coupon or whatever and I guess put in my order that I would like this to be able to come at this particular.

Daylene Long (29:42):

Okay. That sounds good. And you mentioned Carolina. Is there anything else that you typically would get from Carolina?

Teresa Massey (29:55):

Just I pretty much, I guess when you're looking at Carolina and Flynn, I kind of look at Flynn when we are doing physical science and chemistry type things. And Carolina, when I'm doing more of the biology type things, environmental, I kind of put environmental and biology together.

Daylene Long (30:22):

Okay. And with Carolina or Flynn, have you had any really great experiences or any that were not so great that you can share?

Teresa Massey (30:35):

No. I mean, basically to me they're just about the same. Just companies that just provide, I haven't had any, I wouldn't say good or bad, they provide what they say and you just go with it. Sometimes they become a default. Many times when I say, when we need, all of a sudden we need to order, you kind of sometimes end up just going with them because you have their catalog and because you have to hurry up and order or because you know the name. So you just go online and just order.

Daylene Long (31:15):

You mentioned the catalog. Do you typically use a paper catalog or do you typically go online or a combination?

Teresa Massey (31:24):

Probably a combination, if I'm asking. Sometimes, I mean now things are changing so much. I sometimes like to be able to open up a catalog, maybe that has to do with my age, but also online works because online you can just put in what you want and then you can find it very easily. The catalog, you've got to go and look in, look it up and see what page it's on and those type things. So a combination I would say.

Daylene Long (31:55):

Okay. Let's see. I just have a couple last questions then I'm going to see if Kim has any for us.

Teresa Massey (32:03):

Okay.

Daylene Long (32:04):

Does your school have an account with Amazon where you get supplies?

Teresa Massey (32:13):

No.

Daylene Long (32:15):

Okay.

Teresa Massey (32:15):

Not that I know of, no. I mean, like I say, we use, I'm not sure if they're approved vendor or not. So I would say no. I've never seen anything where we could order from Amazon.

Daylene Long (32:30):

Okay. Oh, are there any vendors that you consider yourself to be loyal to?

Teresa Massey (32:44):

Let me plug my computer in real quick.

Daylene Long (32:47):

Okay.

Teresa Massey (32:47):

The batteries. It's telling me the battery's going on. Hold on one second. I didn't. Yeah, we don't

Daylene Long (32:51):

Want to lose you,

Teresa Massey (32:53):

Uhuh. Not again.

Daylene Long (32:56):

I

Teresa Massey (32:56):

Don't know Why I didn't have that plugged in. Okay. I'm back. Alright. So say again the question.

Daylene Long (33:07):

Are there any vendors you consider yourself to be loyal to and if yes, why?

Teresa Massey (33:14):

Well, as I say, any of the vendors that, like I say, I know, I mean if you ask me to name all of 'em right now, doesn't mean that I can name them all, but I threw out Carolina Flynn and I know sometimes some of these companies, they change names and get bought out or whatever, but I'm just loyal to them because like I say, I may have a catalog or I know the name to pull up. I do sometimes receive catalogs from some smaller companies. And I would say if I didn't know the name and all of a sudden I need to order, then I'm not really going know to order from them. Especially like I say, when they say, okay, you got money, you got to spend it like tomorrow, that kind of thing.

Daylene Long (34:04):

Yeah.

Teresa Massey (34:05):

So

Daylene Long (34:05):

It's the vendors who stick in your mind that Right. Okay. That makes sense. Kim, are there any questions you have? Patrica?

Kimberly Herder (34:17):

I am and yes. When it comes to differentiating in the classroom, can you speak to that for a minute?

Teresa Massey (34:26):

Yes. That's one of the expectations for us to differentiate and we use the five E model and the standard space classroom. So part of the standard space is for you to differentiate for students. And so sometimes when you're differentiating, we might differentiate simply because the student may be a ESL, so we have to do something of the same quality, but it might be something where we're supporting them because of their language, or if it's a person that has an IEP, we want them to still be able to participate and learn on the same with the same rigor, but maybe the lesson has to be changed to meet their accommodation. And then sometimes it might just be differentiating for just a regular ed student that somehow whatever their need is that has been identified, we use student profiles. We may need to just change it to help them. Because sometimes giving somebody something that you might have them do two or three times, some students may only be able to do it because of the time they may not be able to process and get it done and get defeated and then just don't do anything. So yeah, we differentiate and we try to differentiate based on each student.

Kimberly Herder (35:49):

That's fantastic. Any

Daylene Long (35:50):

Other questions, Kim? Okay. Do you want to just walk Theresa through next steps?

Kimberly Herder (35:58):

Yes. So thank you for participating and thank you for your diligence in getting in and making it through the fire.

Teresa Massey (36:09):

I know luckily it wasn't a real fire, thank God, but the fire really is.

Kimberly Herder (36:15):

So this afternoon you'll get an email from me with a thank you and a couple other questions. If you think of anything in the next day, next few days, whatever that you'd like to add to the conversation to be able to get to the clients, let us know. And then also we'll ask if you would be willing to be involved in something like this again in the future, another interview process.

Teresa Massey (36:48):

Sure. Yeah.

Daylene Long (36:50):

And you'll get your gift certificate this afternoon after we have our last one. I will send those out this afternoon. So you'll get those. It'll give you a choice between, I think it's a Visa gift card, a target card. There's a few different options that you'll get with that. So thank you again for meeting with us today and jumbling it all in with the fire drill and all that other kind of stuff. We really appreciate it and we really appreciate all that you do for students. We know that you've got an important job. Kim and I are both parents and so we are very grateful for the work that you do and for everything you do for teachers as well.

Teresa Massey (37:36):

I appreciate you all listening and reaching out. Sometimes we don't always feel like people are listening to what we want and what we need, so I appreciate that as well.

Daylene Long (37:46):

And you're part of our community now, so if there are things that you think of along the way, even if it's in four months or whatever, just drop me an email. I'm on social media as well, so feel free to reach out because we do have conduits to the bigger vendors that make decisions about these things.

Teresa Massey (38:08):

Okay, well thank you all so much.

Daylene Long (38:10):

Thank you. Bye-Bye

Teresa Massey (38:12):

Bye.

Daylene Long (00:03):

Okay, so why don't you tell us a little bit about today's.

Kimberly Herder (00:11):

This is Cody Christensen. He has been teaching in Colonial Beach High School, colonial Beach, Virginia since 2016. It's grades eight through 12, high school 620 students. It's a title one school, and this fall, the administration moved him from in this classroom to the district, it ordering person or curriculum and curriculum ordering

Daylene Long (00:51):

Because their main goal for this year is aligning budget

Kimberly Herder (00:53):

With academic goals

Daylene Long (00:56):

Also to increase staff retention, and the main way of doing that is increasing professional development. Okay. Do you know what any of their district academic goals are?

Kimberly Herder (01:09):

Yeah, right now they're in the bottom half of the state, but so science, all the STEM needs to, well, in reading everything needs to go up. They say he's down as an Amazon and Flynn loyalist, but does mention Carolina in previous ordering. So his position is to get the classrooms, technology and curriculum everything up to, apparently that seems to be the biggest goal is the complaint of they're not in the 21st or 20 century. So

Daylene Long (01:54):

In terms of technology

Kimberly Herder (01:56):

And curriculum.

Daylene Long (01:57):

And curriculum. Okay. And they're Virginia. Let's see, what did he teach when he was a teacher?

Kimberly Herder (02:07):

He was the science chair. He's

Daylene Long (02:10):

The science chair.

Kimberly Herder (02:12):

So he did have biology, chemistry,

Daylene Long (02:18):

But he clicked the life sciences box, so we know at least he was a life science teacher. Let's see. Any other thoughts on Cody?

Kimberly Herder (02:38):

Well, he is been teaching, looks like he did his schooling in Utah and was there for about 10 years before he moved to Virginia. Looks like he got married about that time. You

Daylene Long (02:53):

Know everything, Kim. All right, I'm trying. You ready?

Kimberly Herder (02:57):

Yep. Hey there. Hello. Cody Christensen. That's

Cody Christensen (03:21):

Me.

Kimberly Herder (03:21):

Okay, well I'm Kim Herder and I'm with Daylene Long and we're with Catapult X and doing science, life science research and very happy that you've said yes to the interview and in the next 40, 45 minutes is going to go pretty quickly and we're going to ask you lots of questions. Okay.

Daylene Long (03:49):

Cody, do you have a way of turning up your audio just a little bit?

Cody Christensen (03:53):

Lemme see if I can manage that. Let's see. Let's see. Is that any better?

Daylene Long (04:11):

That's a little

Cody Christensen (04:11):

Bit better,

Daylene Long (04:12):

Yeah, there we go. Okay. Okay, and we are recording today, but it's just for note taking purposes. I promise you won't end up on YouTube and I'm not going to ask you to do a TikTok dance, so just wanted to let you know that I need to be able to keep all my notes in order and not forget things and all that other kind of good stuff. Let's see. So I want to just kind of go through a few of the basics. Let's see. Sorry, it's eight in the morning, so I'm kind of trying to get my UNC caffeinated brain going.

Kimberly Herder (04:54):

Well, I'll fine jump for a second. I'm going to jump off screen here in a minute and do the technical stuff, but watch that from behind and then jump back in when necessary. But when Daylene is done with her kind of prep for you too, we'd like to hear a little bit about you and your background for a minute too. Okay.

Cody Christensen (05:12):

Okay. Yeah.

Daylene Long (05:15):

Okay. So let's see. One of the main goals for this, Cody, is that we really want to understand, we have a client that really wants to understand what the experience is when you're buying life science materials for classroom or for multiple classrooms. Kim told me that you've been a science department chair and that you're at the district now. So we really want to understand what those goals are, what those experiences are, and the objective is to better serve educators. We want to know where our client can be better at any part of the process, that kind of thing. And then at the end, we're going to give you a chance to kind of speak directly to the product development teams that we work with and to kind of say, oh, you know what? In an ideal world, I would love it if this were available for teachers or I would love it if this were available for students.

Daylene Long (06:18):

So kind of thinking through those things of how can we work together to really support science teachers and support science education learning. So that's our main objective. You're going to see that we ask a lot of what and why questions, just kind of digging around for how you feel about things. Anything that either brought you joy or that you found frustrating or any of those kinds of things. There are no right or wrong answers and a lot of people, it helps them to think of Kim and I as filming a documentary where we're kind of like, okay, we're doing a documentary inside your classroom of the science materials and how they work for students and how they work for teachers and that kind of stuff. So that's the basic fundamentals and as Kim mentioned, we'd love to hear just a little bit more about especially your new role at the district.

Cody Christensen (07:21):

Okay, so let's see. I was teaching science here at Colonial Beach. I've been teaching science for nine years. This year I actually moved over, so my new job is an instructional technology resource teacher, so I'll be dealing a little bit more with the technology side of things.

Daylene Long (07:43):

In your last role though, you indicated that you had purchased some life science materials for your school?

Cody Christensen (07:51):

Yes. Is that

Daylene Long (07:51):

Correct? Okay. I think let's start there and then let's maybe move a little bit more into maybe how your objectives and stuff have changed now that you're of the district and how that looks different and that type of thing, if that works for you.

Cody Christensen (08:05):

Okay.

Daylene Long (08:07):

Okay. So you had mentioned in the last six months that you had purchased some life science materials. Tell me a little bit about that. What was the first moment that you went, okay, I need to get something for the classrooms?

Cody Christensen (08:22):

So for this, a lot of the things I do, I did do place an order every year to make sure we have the things that we need for the classroom every year we need a few new beakers because some of them get dropped. Glass stir rods are one that we go through a lot and then just making sure we had those, I'm trying to think of the word, those usable materials, the ones that get consumed as the year goes on. Things for labs, especially dissections that we would just need, again, going through the process of deciding where I would buy them mostly I went online. We had a couple that we had approved in years past. I think that situation's a little different now. More recently they did approve Amazon as one of our orders, but a lot of those things like if I really wanted to get owl pellets off of Amazon, that's a little bit harder to find than it is going to an actual science dealer, I guess not dealer supplier. There we go. And so I went through one of the companies that we already had connections with because I'd already used them and that was just kind of my default, who I went with.

Daylene Long (09:43):

So a couple of things. I apologize for my cat's tail coming in and out of the video. She is one of our office workers. I like to call her the insubordinate because I can tell her not to run in front of the camera all I want and it won't happen. Going back to when you kind of do an inventory to see what you're going to need for next year, when does that occur and when does your ordering occur?

Cody Christensen (10:12):

So the inventory kind of needs to take place throughout the year. I have certain labs that we do and I need to take count of what it is I'm going to need. The order doesn't usually end up coming till the end of near the end of the semester when students are going to be getting their grades in and I'm getting ready for the next year unless I just completely forgot to do it. Then it would come at the beginning of the next semester before we start in with new things.

Daylene Long (10:44):

So you do it each semester or you do it once a year?

Cody Christensen (10:49):

I typically had two orders a year, so one per semester

Daylene Long (10:54):

And then just because everybody's semesters are different, what months are those usually at the end of a semester?

Cody Christensen (11:02):

Typically I would be ordering in December and let's see, may so December and May.

Daylene Long (11:09):

Okay, that makes sense. Are there any tools you use to make that inventory? Do you have any spreadsheets or, I don't know, online tools or anything like that?

Cody Christensen (11:21):

For me, it was just paper and pencil, just remembering what I needed and making sure I made notes.

Daylene Long (11:27):

Okay, that sounds good. And you mentioned that you had a few go-to vendors that you've used in the past. Who are those?

Cody Christensen (11:36):

The main one that I can think of now is Flin Scientific. They're the one that was approved when I started working here since then. I think others were still able to buy from other lenders, but they were the one that was approved. So that's kind of the one that's just in the forefront of my brain. I know we've gotten a few of our safety things through Grainger. Again, that was one that I worked with before I started teaching, so it just kind of came to the front of my mind.

Daylene Long (12:03):

Okay. Let's see. So with Flynn, is there, what do you typically get from them? Is it the materials you mentioned earlier or give me an idea of what you typically buy from Flynn?

Cody Christensen (12:18):

The typical year thing would be those consumables. That's the word I was looking for, the beakers every year, making sure we have glass stir rods, making sure we have forceps, but I would also get kits through them. So if I had a particular lab that I knew I wanted to do something new, they had those pre-made lab kits, which were always really nice to have that. I just have all of the stuff in one kit and the issue kind of coming up when those kits had consumables in them that I then had to go back and order again if I wanted to use it the next year and I forgot to, oh, I forgot to get this blood typing kit because I thought I had the kit already.

Daylene Long (13:01):

Okay. You mentioned the blood typing kit, so there other kits that you particularly like from Flynn?

Cody Christensen (13:07):

Let's see. The blood typing kit was a really good one. They had an erosion kit that I liked that one because I could just use the soil from outside. I didn't have to keep ordering that. There was another one that was bingo for chemistry, it was the stoichiometry bingo. I'm trying to think through a few of our other kits, but yeah, are a few of the Go-to ones that I had.

Daylene Long (13:34):

Were there any that you wish you had that you thought, oh man, we kind of piecemeal this together ourselves and I really wish somebody would come up with a kit for fill in the blank?

Cody Christensen (13:48):

Let's see. I'm trying to think through. I think a kit for the different scientists would actually be good. That's one of the things that my students struggled with a little bit was I'm trying to remember which scientists did what, and maybe having a demonstration of how their experiments went as a kit that the kids could do and see, oh, this is what, maybe not bore, but this is what one of the scientists did. Milliken did this as he went through. I think that could definitely be helpful. The other thing was the kids got really excited about the escape room kind of games, but there weren't pre-made ones that I could just purchase and we did end up going through a company, but it was a little bit more elementary. So maybe something like that where it's a lock and a system for them to get to the end would be helpful.

Daylene Long (14:44):

Okay. Those are really interesting ideas. The scientist one is really interesting too. Do you guys to incorporate career tech into your sciences or what prompted that? I've never actually had anybody talk about scientist kits before. Yeah,

Cody Christensen (15:04):

Especially for chemistry, that's kind of where I go. I know we're more focusing on life science, but one of the sections for the end of year test, which in Virginia we call those the SOLs, is understanding the processes and part of the understanding the processes, knowing how it came about. So when we look at scientists who found something or proved or at least supported something, we'd like to look at their experiments and what they looked at to help get that information across. So thinking of biology, it would be like Darwin having some of the things that Darwin looked at. We always take a look at the pictures of the fins that he used to figure out that, hey, this is natural selection, and let the kids look at those similarities and the differences and come to their own conclusions from that.

Daylene Long (16:01):

I like it when people teach the how do we know what we know about science that it's not something you're just memorizing, but how do we know what we know is your background in chemistry or your educational background or My

Cody Christensen (16:16):

Background is actually biology. That's where my degree is. And then when I got the job here at Colonial Beach, I was kind of thrown into chemistry. So I taught chemistry for, let's see, seven years straight before

Daylene Long (16:32):

They gave that to another teacher. So that was

Cody Christensen (16:36):

Kind of where my teaching focus was, but I also taught a bunch of different, I've taught everything except for physics that we had.

Daylene Long (16:46):

That happens a lot. We see that a lot when we talk to educators. Let's see. Is there anything about your experience with Flynn that you either just really appreciated and liked? And conversely, is there anything that came up that frustrated you?

Cody Christensen (17:10):

The thing I really appreciated was having the safety data sheets with everything they sent me, just making sure I had that on file. I know that was a requirement that I had to go through and find all the chemicals that we had and find the safety data sheets for them and put them together in a folder. And just getting those when I got the material was really helpful and something that was a little bit frustrating. We had a couple times where I ordered Petri dishes with the algin at the auger in the bottom, and they took a little bit too long to deliver those. I don't know if that was on the part of Flynn or if that was on the part of the distributor, but those actually kind of went bad, so I wasn't able to use those. But they did get me new ones, which ended up being okay, but I did miss the day that I was going to do the lab. Oh,

Daylene Long (18:08):

Okay. That makes sense. So it's important to you to get the materials when you need the materials and to ensure that it's usable for your lab. Yeah. Okay. And it's interesting too that you mentioned that one of your requirements is to pull all those safety data sheets together for the chemicals. Is that an OSHA requirement, a school requirement? Who tasked you with that?

Cody Christensen (18:36):

I'm trying to remember exactly who we got in trouble with. I think it was the fire marshal actually, when they went through, they needed to make sure we had the folder, and that was one that I just kind of, when they said, Hey, we need to make sure we have this. When I started working here, I kind of took that to heart because I wanted to make sure I have the information I need. If something happens to any of my students, having forbid I know exactly where to look for that information.

Daylene Long (19:07):

Yeah, that totally makes sense. Okay, so we talked about Flynn. You mentioned dissections earlier. Who do you typically go to for dissections? Is that Flynn as well?

Cody Christensen (19:23):

Yeah, I think it would be Flynn. I know there are a couple other ones, but that's the only one that's really coming to my mind. I'm trying to think through without Googling. I don't remember offhand. Yeah,

Daylene Long (19:37):

That's okay. Do you remember what kind of dissections you get or things you get to dissect from plan?

Cody Christensen (19:45):

My first year I think we tried the fetal pigs

Daylene Long (19:50):

And it was just such a mess that we kind of stopped doing that after my first year. And

Cody Christensen (19:57):

Then after that, the big one, the one that the kids liked the most was kind of the laced messy was the owl pellets. So owl pellets have the little bones of the rodents that they've eaten in them, and so the kids are able to pull those apart and see what's inside basically.

Daylene Long (20:14):

Yeah. Okay. Interesting. Let me flip through my notes here. Let's see. Do you remember at the school you were teaching at as a science department chair, a little bit about what your budget was and then also maybe the process of ordering for other departments?

Cody Christensen (20:43):

Yeah, the budget was, it was a little under a thousand dollars a year and we kind of took that information and decided where the need was. Everyone got a certain amount for those consumables, like we say, and then if we have a little extra saved over, I believe this year we ordered new microscopes, which is something that had been needed for a few years, and then we just kind of work that on a needed basis and distribute that way. So

Daylene Long (21:22):

The bigger purchases for microscopes can come out of your annual budget. Do you ever refurbish other pieces of technology where it requires you to go outside of your typical budget?

Cody Christensen (21:39):

Yeah, we actually had a local guy the first two years that I worked here where he took our microscopes and refurbished. So he did that with our microscopes and our scales, our balances, and I believe we stayed within that a thousand dollars budget though because he was local, he was doing it kind of as a service to the school, but also he needed to pay for parts and pay for himself. I don't remember exactly the amounts that he charged, but I think we did stay within the science budget for that year.

Daylene Long (22:12):

Okay. And do you guys have an AP section or did you have an AP section at the school you were teaching at?

Cody Christensen (22:19):

Yeah, we've been working with AP classes a little bit. It's a little bit harder to have teachers that are certified in that. I don't yet have my master's degree, so I haven't been teaching any ap, but our current by a biology teacher would be able to get that and teach the AP classes. We just haven't gone through that process yet.

Daylene Long (22:48):

Okay. Let's see. And then I see you also mentioned, and then we'll switch over to your new role. You also mentioned that you buy from Amazon. Now, is that individual accounts? Do you have a business or school account? How does that work?

Cody Christensen (23:09):

We have a school account, so what I do is I would go on Amazon and put together a shopping card or a wishlist, and then I would take that to our finance person. Her name's Judy. She's fantastic. And she would then take that and order it through the school's account. I believe it is shared between the two schools. I could be mistaken. It might be just be one account or it might be two separate accounts.

Daylene Long (23:36):

Okay. Did those orders happen at the twice a year as well, or are they all year long?

Cody Christensen (23:42):

Those are, again, just pretty much twice a year. If there's something that I absolutely need and I forgot about it, I would be able to squeeze in an order, but we try to keep 'em to two a year.

Daylene Long (23:54):

Okay, that makes sense. Let's see. Okay, let's switch over to your new role. Tell us a little bit about what you're doing at the district level. Tell us a little bit about what your objectives are there, the role that you play.

Cody Christensen (24:14):

So the role I stepped into is an instructional technology resource teacher. So I work on the technology side and it's kind of a coaching position for teachers.

Cody Christensen (24:24):

Being in a small district, I do inherit some of the regular tech stuff like fixing printers and making sure iPads are working and things like that. But the main goal is to help teachers to use technology appropriately and make sure that it's actually helpful in their classes and to be able to show them how to use that in their education. So one of the things that I really hope to do as far as the science side goes is get to use some of the electronic probeware and make sure we're using the graphing software and things like that appropriately in class and make sure the kids are making use of it and seeing what kind of standards they would expect if they went into a technology field.

Daylene Long (25:07):

Yeah, it sounds like a fun new role for you.

Cody Christensen (25:10):

Yeah.

Daylene Long (25:12):

So you mentioned probes and graphing software. What kind of exposure have you had to those? Do you have one in your mind that you're thinking of?

Cody Christensen (25:22):

We have some in the back room that honestly I kind of forgot about.

Daylene Long (25:27):

I don't remember

Cody Christensen (25:30):

Which company we went with for those, but there was a box that we needed to plug the probe into and then plug it into the computer and we lost the box. So we kind of just never used it.

Daylene Long (25:43):

That makes sense, that technology's progressed a little.

Cody Christensen (25:47):

Yeah. And

Daylene Long (25:49):

Then, let's see, are there other, if you're looking at your two, three year goals for what you would want to have trained and implemented with your staff, especially focusing on the science, what kind of things are you thinking you'd like to move them towards?

Cody Christensen (26:10):

I think one of the things that I really want to get involved in is the iPad actually has an app. There's an Apple science app. I don't remember what it is offhand. I know it's purple, but the iPad has light sensors in it. It has a motion sensor. It has a bunch of technology that is just there inherent in these iPads that each of the kids have that we're not really utilizing where we could be. So that's one that I would like to get into and really hammer down and help 'em figure out.

Daylene Long (26:45):

Okay. So are you guys a one-to-one school?

Cody Christensen (26:48):

Yes, I've worked for both the elementary and the high school. We're both one-to-one where the high school, they take theirs home at the end of the night, but the elementary, they leave theirs plugged in overnight at the school just to make sure they're safe and charging.

Daylene Long (27:04):

That makes sense. And it sounds like a really good goal with the graphic and analysis that you've got going on there. Let me look through my notes. Anything else that you can think of in terms of your current role and science education and towards of future goals?

Cody Christensen (27:26):

Let's see. Not that I can think of offhand. Just trying to think of, one of my goals is to make sure that teachers feel comfortable with someone helping them. I don't know exactly how much that ties in. A lot of teachers feel like if someone comes in to help, they're in trouble where that's not really the case. We want to share that you're not in trouble just because something could be improved. It's just something that we could work on and help with.

Daylene Long (28:03):

Do you ever work with any of the vendors to help with the professional development training or does that all end up on you?

Cody Christensen (28:12):

Mostly it ends up on me. I work with a few of the vendors when we end up with a new testing software, but typically it's just to get the information and then I will go in and explore it myself and try to figure things out

Daylene Long (28:29):

From

Cody Christensen (28:29):

There.

Daylene Long (28:31):

That's helpful. So I want to switch it over now to really looking down the road and drawing on your experience both as a classroom teacher and as a district educator. Is there anything that you think is missing out there that would be helpful for teachers or helpful for students?

Cody Christensen (28:57):

I think it's a lot of that real world experience. How do we tie this in because we get so many students who are like, when are we going to use this? And a lot of teachers have no answer for that. And a lot of the teachers are really just focusing on getting 'em through the testing, especially for biology because that's the SOL that they have to pass that to graduate or they're going to end up taking the chemistry SOL, which is going to be way more difficult. So they have to pass the biology SOL to graduate. So the teacher focuses on getting 'em past the biology. SOL, the student focuses on, I don't really want to deal with this. So trying to get that real world experience in would definitely be helpful. I tried to tie it in as much as I could, but maybe hearing from people in the profession I think would be something that would really be helpful for them to see that it's not just, oh, I have to learn about mammals in the classroom. Oh, I could actually go and work with whales or deer or whatever in the real world and see how that ties back to community and just even having a job. And yeah, so I'd go with that. Real world experience is a little bit lacking and I think that's something that we should push forward with.

Daylene Long (30:21):

Okay. How do you prep them for the state exam? It sounds like that's a really important part of what you're doing with teaching for biology. So how do you get them, how do you make sure they know, let me put this differently. Are there any tools that you use to prep them for the exam in terms of sample questions or drills or anything like that? And is there anything that's missing that you wish you had?

Cody Christensen (30:51):

Yeah, one of the things that we use, there's a Jefferson Laboratories, I should remember that one when I was going through. They have an SOL review site where the kids can just go on and it will ask them questions from previous SOL tests and they can see what the test is going to look like and how they should be answering those questions. Sometimes students suffer from test anxiety and even just seeing what the test is going to look like is a real help for them. What kind of questions are going to be there? A few of the things I used was, one of the things, especially for that state test, is vocab training. Just making sure they know and understand those vocabulary words. And one of the things that really helped was I created some taboo cards, which is a game where you can't say certain words and those vocab words, if you put the three most associated words with that thing on the card and they can't say it, they really actually have to understand the word to get it across. So the example I always use is photosynthesis. You want someone to guess the word photosynthesis, but you can't say green. You can't say sunlight and you can't say tree. And how do you get them to figure out what that vocabulary word is and if they understand those words, a lot of times they can put the word into context of the question and then get the answer right because they know where the word would apply.

Daylene Long (32:27):

That's a great way of doing that. You're the first person I've talked to that has done that. That's really a great way of drawing out whether or not they know what it means in terms of function and those types of things. So that's very interesting. Let's see. I know I had another question hanging on there. Is there anything that you wish you had for preparing them for the exam?

Cody Christensen (33:00):

Let's see. I'm just trying to think through, our state is always very secretive about the exam, and I think this is for all states where they don't release the test and a lot of times we're not a hundred percent sure what's going to be on there and the kids have no idea. It is something where I would love to be able to see the test beforehand. In the SOLs here in Virginia, we actually just switched from the old standards of learning, which is what SOL stands for to a newer version. It was adopted in 2018, but with covid, we haven't implemented it till, I think this is the first year.

Cody Christensen (33:50):

It's a little tough to say, okay, yes, I have these guidelines, but I have no idea what kind of questions are going to come up. So some kind of bank of what is the test actually going to look like would definitely be helpful. So the one we talked about before, they're all using the old 2015 standards because that's all that's available. I think that would be the best way to prep them that way. But yeah, a few of the things would be maybe some physical manipulatives. We were able to make a lot out of styrofoam and just what we have, but some kind of thing that those students who learn a little bit better by actually moving something around might be helpful rather than just kind of sitting and hearing words. Yeah,

Daylene Long (34:42):

That makes a lot of sense. For your state exam, do you do three-dimensional or multi-dimensional testing? And what I mean by that is do you have an open-ended part where they have to analyze a phenomenon based on, I don't know, cross country concept or talk about what kinds of science and engineering practices they use to solve that?

Cody Christensen (35:10):

Not currently. I know the state's trying to move a little bit more toward that, but excuse me there kind of the closest we get to that is on the test. They do have ones where they move things around, they match the different words and they actually have to click and move it, but that's pretty much as close

Daylene Long (35:30):

As they

Cody Christensen (35:31):

Gave. It's

Daylene Long (35:31):

All electronic right now in terms of multiple choice, drag and drop, that kind of thing. No open-ended? No, not in the science section. At least I know there are some open-ended in the English sections, but not in science. Okay. That sounds good. Kim, I want to bring you back and see what questions you have for Cody.

Kimberly Herder (35:56):

No, again, I'm going to ask on for students who are falling behind or have been out for whatever reason, do you use kits or how does the classroom, or how in your classroom do you bring that them back up to where everybody else is at?

Cody Christensen (36:19):

For my classes, we actually use an online learning management system. The Canvas is the one that we use. So for days that we just have assignments that's posted online, so if they miss class, everything, the notes and everything, my presentation is posted online for them to make that up. If they miss a lab day, that gets a little bit trickier because typically we want to do that altogether. And I'm a little hesitant to send lab kits home with students because I know they're not going to make it home. They're not going to make it back to me, I guess is the thing. For example, we did a bonding lab where they have little dots that connect together that represent oxygen and hydrogen, and if they just miss that day, I would have to either have them work through it without the kit or find a time when I can work with them in lab, maybe after school or during lunch and they could actually get the manipulative part of that done.

Daylene Long (37:26):

Sounds good. Kim, what other questions do you have?

Kimberly Herder (37:32):

Really that was it. It sounds like you're having to, or you did develop a lot on your own. You said you had some kits. Are there other kits that you would like to see or is that, I mean,

Cody Christensen (37:50):

There are a few that would be helpful. There was one that I kind of had to come up with on my own. It was a mining kit where they went through with different tools and found out the cost associated with mining. And it was really interesting because they were able to bring in budgeting and mining that we had talked about in class, but they were also able to take in, we put fines on the different messes that they made during the mining process. So if they made too much of a mess, they got a fine, but they noticed that if they mined enough of the mineral that we were looking for, the fine was basically not even there. So a bunch of the kids just ended up dumping the bucket out and paying the little fine because they ended up with all the material,

Cody Christensen (38:42):

Which is something that happens in the real world. Let's see. One of the kits that would have been helpful, I'm trying to think through because I know there was one that I had in my brain just a second ago. Gosh, let's see. Oh, play Tectonics was one that we had a hard time finding something that was actually put together for it and we ended up using a lot of students bringing in foam pieces that they had from trash at home that we ended up doing the subduction and the different ways that the plates come together and move apart on the earth. So that would definitely be helpful. Trying to think through if there's anything else. Like I mentioned, something with the scientists

Daylene Long (39:35):

Would

Cody Christensen (39:35):

Be really helpful, like a kit for each scientist maybe. I know some of their experiments are a little bigger than just what we can do in class, but something that really hones in on what work they did and what that actually meant for the scientific community.

Daylene Long (39:53):

How we know what we know.

Kimberly Herder (39:56):

I have one more to follow up. What about the local economy? Is there anything that would be a kit that would say, okay, some of these kids aren't going off to university?

Cody Christensen (40:06):

Yeah, I think that could definitely be helpful for the job market going forward. I know here we do a lot of work. I work in Colonial Beach, so we're a crab an oyster community, so there's a lot of fishing that goes on here and it would be a little bit tough to do it location specific, but for us looking at how the crabs come in, how many they get per year, and then how that actually affects the environment itself. The oysters, we actually have a whole history here of the oyster wars where people were dredging for oysters, which was really ruining the bottom of the bay and the river here, and it led to production just tanking. And so we had to let it kind of come back before they could even start harvesting them again. But again, I don't know exactly how you would do location specific stuff like that in a kit. I dunno.

Daylene Long (41:18):

Yeah, makes sense. Well, thank you so much for your time today. We really appreciate all that you do for teachers and all that you do for students. It sounds like you've got some great work ahead of you in your new role too. You Kim, do you want to talk to Cody about next steps of what he can expect?

Kimberly Herder (41:39):

Yes. So this afternoon or as late as tomorrow morning, but probably this afternoon you'll get an email from me. One is a thank you, which honestly thank you very much for taking your time doing this and everything you do in the classroom on there will be a, if you think of anything to get back to me, if you think of anything else today, the next week, whatever it is, it's like, oh man, I should have included that. So that will be there. And then also asking the question for you to think about is our client base is pretty broad. If you would like to be a part of something like this again, if you'd be open in interest in that. So that would be good. And then the $95 gift card will be coming from Daylene. You should get that today.

Daylene Long (42:30):

It'll be later today, but you should get that today.

Cody Christensen (42:33):

Okay.

Kimberly Herder (42:35):

Okay.

Daylene Long (42:37):

Thank you so much. If you've got any questions or additional thoughts for us, we've had a couple of teachers just shoot us a note and say, Hey, I forgot to talk about this, or I would really like you guys to know this, so please feel free to send us an email really at any time with any kind of follow-up information that you have. You're part of our community now, and so just being able to get exchange feedback I think is going to be useful.

Cody Christensen (43:08):

Okay. Alright. Thank you very much. Alright, Thank

Daylene Long (43:11):

You so much.

Cody Christensen (43:12):

All right. Bye-Bye Bye-Bye

Kimberly Herder (43:13):

Care.

Daylene Long (43:15):

Kim, do you want to stay on for a sec?

Kimberly Herder (43:17):

Yeah, let me

Daylene Long (43:19):

Stop recording. I.

Daylene Long (00:00):

Oh, okay. So Ms. Kimberly, what do we know about Manuel

Kimberly Herder (00:08):

That he is? Well, first off, he's a science department chair at St. John Paul, the second academy in Boca Raton, Florida. Private School geared for, well, 99% of their kiddos graduated last week, a hundred percent went on to higher education.

Daylene Long (00:33):

Wow.

Kimberly Herder (00:33):

Yeah, that's

Daylene Long (00:34):

A stats right there.

Kimberly Herder (00:36):

It is both a Carolina and Flynn user, but when most reliable or in the pre-think thought Carolina was the most reliable. So we'll see how that plays out.

Daylene Long (00:51):

Meaning that they listed Carolina first in top of brand.

Kimberly Herder (00:56):

Top of mind.

Daylene Long (00:57):

Top of mind. Brand awareness.

Kimberly Herder (01:02):

Yes. Science department chair. It's Ian Catholic School, so very service orientated and community service.

Daylene Long (01:18):

What's the difference between a Lasallian school and a Jesuit school?

Kimberly Herder (01:25):

It's who they were founded on, and the Jesuits are academic, but I don't, don't know. I'm not Catholic, but I just know it from, all right.

Daylene Long (01:38):

He is here and it's coming up as David Bergos, so let's clarify that a little bit

Kimberly Herder (01:46):

Too. Okay.

Manuel Burgos (02:02):

Hello?

Daylene Long (02:03):

Hello.

Kimberly Herder (02:05):

Okay.

Daylene Long (02:05):

Can you hear us okay?

Manuel Burgos (02:07):

Yes, I can hear you fine. Let me just modify the name on here. Hold on a second.

Daylene Long (02:13):

That was one of the things we were going to ask about. Or do you go by Manuel or?

Manuel Burgos (02:20):

I go by Manuel. That's actually, my son used my tablet yesterday for a meeting. He was doing piano, so he used my tablet for his piano class and now I don't know how to change it. Hold on a second.

Kimberly Herder (02:37):

Oh, that's okay. We can,

Daylene Long (02:40):

We

Kimberly Herder (02:40):

Got to figure out of it.

Daylene Long (02:42):

We just wanted to make sure we knew

Manuel Burgos (02:44):

That's me,

Daylene Long (02:45):

What you go by and that kind of stuff. It reminds me of that, what was it? It was somewhere during the pandemic where a student had changed his parents' ID and it was some little, maybe like a little dog head or something, and he didn't know how to get it off the screen, so he goes to this big meeting. That was a good one.

Kimberly Herder (03:10):

Yeah,

Manuel Burgos (03:11):

You can

Kimberly Herder (03:11):

See. And we can even see you too. I know.

Manuel Burgos (03:14):

It's great, isn't it? It's wonderful.

Kimberly Herder (03:17):

Well, your son should get highly proficient in technology for yesterday. Well, thank you very much for being here, agreeing to be part of the survey, the interview. I'm Kim Herder, and Daylene is the senior research founder of Catapult, and we've been contracted to do research, gather information on life sciences curriculum. So I'm hoping you can take a minute and just kind of tell a little bit more of your background, how you, because your're department chair and how long have you been at St. John Paul II Academy?

Manuel Burgos (04:06):

I've been here two years. I am the science department chair. I teach anatomy and physiology and also AP biology. I am a 17 year plus ICU nurse, so I bring it into the classroom. A lot of the stuff that I deal with at the hospital, I bring it into class. So I still, on weekends, I work at the hospital still. Let's see, now, I've been doing that for 17 years. Before that, I was a computer engineer for Pepsi and before all of that I used to be in the Navy. I was in the Navy for as a weapons officer for 10 years.

Daylene Long (04:51):

That's the background you have. That's amazing.

Manuel Burgos (04:55):

So yes, and a lot of the students are like, their first question is, how old are you?

Kimberly Herder (05:03):

You're

Manuel Burgos (05:04):

Just like, what?

Kimberly Herder (05:06):

Yes.

Manuel Burgos (05:08):

But it makes it for a very interesting dynamic in the class because I can talk to just about every aspect of what they're looking for, especially for college with some experience in the military. Some of them want to ask about that or classroom with regards to computer science. And of course with the medical field, I can talk to it very well with regards to nursing or what other fields in the medicine or programs that can be involved in. So that's kind of where we're at. Right.

Kimberly Herder (05:44):

Here's fantastic. I'm a step off screen, but I will be here to handle technical difficulties and pop back on if there's something that I think we need to go a little more deeper or something like that. So not

Manuel Burgos (05:56):

A problem with you. Okay. Okay.

Daylene Long (05:59):

So Emmanuel, I wanted to let you know too that we definitely want to talk about curricular resources, but we also want to talk about the materials that you use in the classroom, whether it's for labs or hands-on experiments and that kind of stuff. So we're really going to take kind of a broad approach to life science materials, and our objective really is to understand better what you value in the vendors that you use, what makes your job easier as an educator, what makes different things better for students and that type of thing. So we're kind of going with a broad range here.

Daylene Long (06:47):

We are recording, but I promise you won't end up on YouTube. It's just for our notes so I don't have to remember everything. So I just wanted to let you be aware of that. And let me see. You're going to see that we ask a lot of what and why questions, and we're really just trying to understand the whole experience that you have around the materials that you get for your AP bio class and for your anatomy and physiology class. There aren't any right or wrong answers. And the best way to think of it is if Kim and I are coming in and we're filming a documentary, so we we're kind of watching the whole process of how you make choices for your classroom. So that's kind of a good way to think of it as we start to ask questions and really understand where you're coming from. Sound good?

Manuel Burgos (07:45):

Sure. Sounds great. Can you see me okay?

Daylene Long (07:48):

I can. Can you see me okay?

Manuel Burgos (07:50):

Yes.

Daylene Long (07:51):

Okay. Occasionally my cat's tail will go through.

Manuel Burgos (07:55):

Oh yes.

Daylene Long (07:55):

I asked her to please not report to work today, but she insists, so it's hard to argue with a cat. Okay. So let's see. You mentioned in your surveys that you had last purchased recently within the last year for life sciences. Tell me what you bought and who you bought it from, and just kind of walk me through that experience.

Manuel Burgos (08:25):

For life sciences. We bought sea urchins.

Daylene Long (08:30):

Sea urchins, okay.

Manuel Burgos (08:32):

That was an embryology class that we were doing. We've also purchased organs for dissection.

Manuel Burgos (08:42):

We just got a whole bunch of sheep, organs, eyeballs, brain, kidney and heart. And also for my, I guess to see marine environmental sciences section. We just bought rocks. Don't ask me boxes, like rocks. They wanted to set rocks with a nail and they were going to do some magnifying glasses or something to that effect for chemistry. We ordered beakers and some glassware, and we also ordered some chemicals as well too that we needed for one of our labs as well too, for one of our demos. Let's see, now I'm trying to see, for my physics group, I ordered a robotics kit because they have to start from scratch, and also we ordered solid rocket engines from them. They have to do a lab with regards to trying to shoot an egg up into the sky and bring it back down and see how high they can go up. It's like a long-term project for them. It's kind of like something funny, fun for them. So instead

Daylene Long (10:12):

Dropping it, they're actually shooting it up into the sky

Manuel Burgos (10:16):

And they're trying to go for as much height as possible. And it has to do with, they're talking about force equals m mass times acceleration, and they're talking about Newtons and they're talking about aerodynamics and a bunch of other things as well too.

Daylene Long (10:35):

Wow. Go ahead. You were going to, I interrupted. What were you going to say?

Manuel Burgos (10:43):

Let's see, now I'm trying to think of, oh, and we also, for our life sciences, we only get our microscopes refurbished as well too. Just trying to go through each department and make sure that I got everything covered for them and for my chemistry. We also ordered some new burners and some new hot plates as well too. Yeah, that's

Daylene Long (11:20):

Go ahead.

Manuel Burgos (11:21):

No, go ahead.

Daylene Long (11:22):

How do you compile this list? How do you determine what it is that you're going to get for your department and when do you determine that?

Manuel Burgos (11:31):

I normally talk to the teachers and I try to figure out what is it that they need, and I also try to see what we're missing from previous years, what we used up and what has. Over the summer, I went through all the labs and I kind of did a quick inventory to see what we were missing and glassware was missing and was cracked, and some of it was broken, stuff like that. And we had to order new dissection kits, so we needed to get new scalpels and forceps and probes and stuff like that, because I wanted to do the dissection lab, but I wanted to have, you can't dissect if you don't have the tools.

Manuel Burgos (12:22):

And a lot of it came up as, I would say, probably a month prior to the lab or the specific activity, they would come to me and say, I have to sign off on all their purchase orders. So they would bring 'em to me and say, I need this because I want to do this lab in a month and a half, but I don't have X, Y, or Z and I'm missing this. So they would come to me and say, okay. And we would just go through the different vendors and find out which one was the cheapest,

Manuel Burgos (12:52):

Cheapest and the quickest that we could actually more reliable. And I say the best win for us with regards to supplying it. I had one, for example, for my sea urchins. We were going to go with a small company here in Florida, but they wanted, and I wanted just a small half dozen batch of sea urchins because I figured Florida warm weather, how hard it could be. It's just up the street from us. We can just, how cheap can they possibly just deliver it to us? And it seemed okay. The price wise was $88 for the sea urchins. I was like, great, that's perfectly fine. But then shipping was another 300 bucks. They wanted to tack on that, and I was going, how come it's so expensive? I mean, literally you are at best two hours away by car. I mean, literally I could just drive over and pick it up and come back and they're like, well, we don't do things that way. We have to send them overnight with FedEx or with UPS and stuff like that. And they charge us 300 bucks and we're just passing all the cost to you. So I went back to Carolina. Carolina will give me a dozen sea urchins for 180 bucks.

Daylene Long (14:27):

That's good. And

Manuel Burgos (14:28):

Then that's including shipping and everything already in there. That's just one price deal right there.

Daylene Long (14:35):

So it was one package deal with the shipping built into it, and it was less expensive than the local supplier?

Manuel Burgos (14:45):

Correct. And they come from North Carolina toll figure.

Daylene Long (14:50):

Yeah. And are those s, are they live specimens or are they dead specimens that you're

Manuel Burgos (15:02):

They're live.

Daylene Long (15:03):

They're live. Okay.

Manuel Burgos (15:05):

They ship 'em to us next day and it shows up here at the front office and we just get him, they give us a little voucher. We call up and say, I need him for this date. They'll make sure that they have specific requirements for the shipping has to be a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. That's the delivery date that you pick.

Daylene Long (15:26):

That's interesting. So they don't end up there over the weekend or something like that.

Manuel Burgos (15:30):

Exactly. So no one's there to take care of them and stuff like that. So they show up here and each of the sea urchins is individually wrapped in a bag with seawater and they're able to survive for a while.

Daylene Long (15:44):

And then you've talked about reliability being something that was important to you, and you had mentioned that you wanted the best overall win, that it wasn't just about the price. What makes a vendor reliable for you?

Manuel Burgos (16:02):

Being able to someone pick up the phone for customer service, and for my guy that wanted the rocks, he called him up this morning and asked him what specific rocks on them. He goes, someone actually picked up the phone and answered it. I was like, great. I was like that kind of, and the ability to basically say we can have it to you guys in three days, four days, and it's not

Daylene Long (16:34):

So personal service and getting it to you in time that your teachers can do the experiment?

Manuel Burgos (16:42):

Correct.

Daylene Long (16:44):

Okay. And do you remember who it was that you were talking to with the rocks?

Manuel Burgos (16:49):

The rocks was nassco.

Daylene Long (16:53):

Okay,

Manuel Burgos (16:54):

Okay. The Carolina was for the sea urchins and some of the other lab like chemistry and stuff like that. We go through Flint. Flint gives us the best price for dry chemicals and stuff.

Daylene Long (17:12):

Flint is the best for dry chemicals

Manuel Burgos (17:15):

And the best for prices for the beakers and the hot plates. I have it somewhere around here, but it's another company as well too. If you give me a second, I can pull up the invoice,

Daylene Long (17:28):

That'd be great. Sure.

Manuel Burgos (17:53):

Hold on. I actually have it here, but yeah, but that's kind of like here for a second.

Daylene Long (18:11):

No worries. I'm not in a hurry.

Manuel Burgos (18:55):

Fisher Science.

Daylene Long (18:57):

Okay. And that was, you said the beakers that you ordered from Fisher?

Manuel Burgos (19:01):

Yes, that was the fisheries that we got from, and we bought $382 and 30 cents, but because we were on their purchasing services, we ended up getting it for 3 37.

Daylene Long (19:18):

Okay.

Manuel Burgos (19:19):

So we saved about 150 bucks total.

Daylene Long (19:22):

Okay. And is that a district contract that's been negotiated or with your school? Oh, let's see. You're a private school, so was it negotiated then for your school?

Manuel Burgos (19:33):

For our school, actually, we actually had a discount. It was set up through the district, actually.

Daylene Long (19:40):

Okay. And then do any of your other suppliers routinely give you discounts where you've got it set up as part of the contract?

Manuel Burgos (19:51):

Most of our suppliers, they will give us no tax on our supplies because we have the tax exemption form, but that's really the closest thing that we can get to a break on it. Okay.

Daylene Long (20:09):

That makes sense. You held up the Nassco catalog. I was wondering if you could do that again, because I wanted to question, I have a question for you about that. So you've got sticky notes on that, right? So tell me, is that part of your process or tell me how you use the sticky notes with your catalogs?

Manuel Burgos (20:36):

Well, actually the sticky notes here in the catalog is because it was the rock signs. Originally, my environmental teacher was looking at Amazon

Manuel Burgos (20:50):

To purchase the kit from, and I looked at the kit and it was $88 for one set, and he needed three sets to complete the lab for his students, and I got this catalog. I just got the sheep organs behind me. So I was flipping through here and I said, do you need, how many do you need? He was like, well, I need 12 rocks and I have to have this and I need to have a nail so that I could scrape through. And I was like, okay, fine. So I started flipping through this catalog and it has a really neatly broken down by colors, different sections and stuff like that. So I sticky noted and gave it to him and said, here, check it out. You can actually get for the same price that we're getting three, we can actually get 10 for your class if you need that many so you don't have to kind of cut corners and you can have more of a more diverse setup for your lab. He came back to me this afternoon, he says, actually, this will work really great. It'll be cheaper and we can get six. So he goes, I want six instead of three with the other group. So I was like, okay. Okay.

Daylene Long (22:06):

And you mentioned the sheep organs. Did you get the sheep organs from Nassco and that's where the catalog came in or, yes. Okay. All right. That sounds good. So it sounds like you guys put a lot of thought into your financial responsibilities to the school and getting what you called earlier, the overall win for the school.

Manuel Burgos (22:30):

And a lot of times I went to a conference this year for A SPI, which is the AP college board class. So I got some coupons as a result of going to that class. And I do, every now and then I'll go to some of these professional development classes, and one of the things from vendors is that they give you these coupons to buy supplies. So I end up using those for the benefit of my department. I say, I have these coupons for these components and stuff like that, but I'm not going to use them because it's not germane to what I'm teaching in class, but you can use it environmental, and I'll give it to physics and I'll say, okay, chemistry, you guys can go ahead and use it and here's the voucher and you can actually go ahead and make the purchase.

Daylene Long (23:22):

Great. Do you remember which vendors you got those coupons from? At the A SPI

Manuel Burgos (23:30):

Actually, I can actually tell you. Give me a second. Sorry. It's in my email. Everything's in your email these days?

Daylene Long (23:41):

I know.

Manuel Burgos (23:45):

Let's see. Now actually, we got the coupon for I guess called the mini one.

Daylene Long (24:20):

Mini one, okay.

Manuel Burgos (24:21):

Okay. We got one also for biology magnets as well too. And let's see, well, and okay. And we also got a prep kit on company called the Algae Guys.

Daylene Long (25:22):

That's interesting.

Manuel Burgos (25:40):

Oh, here it's, we got a coupon from the Algae Research and Supply Company. Okay.

Daylene Long (25:51):

Did they do any demos with different types of products or vendors at the A SPI or was it more just about teaching AP Biology?

Manuel Burgos (26:02):

They were teaching, but at the same time too, they were actually demoing some of the little products because for the mini one, he actually had the mini one in his lab, and it was like, if you guys want one, and he goes, I'm just going to contact and reach out to these people and I'll let them know that you guys are interested and I'll go ahead and give him your information and they'll send you a coupon.

Daylene Long (26:28):

Very cool. That's nice. And I like that you come back and share them with the rest of your group. When you were studying to be a teacher, did any of your pre-service instructors do anything similar to what they do at the A SPI where they actually go through the lab and demo different products?

Manuel Burgos (26:53):

No.

Daylene Long (26:54):

No? No. Okay. No. All right. That sounds good. And then, let's see, what else would I want to talk to about, let me go through this. So we talked about reliability and oh, are there any vendors that you consider to be your top-notch? Go-to vendors?

Manuel Burgos (27:19):

Carolina I will go to for anything that's alive.

Daylene Long (27:23):

Okay.

Manuel Burgos (27:24):

Okay. Nassco, go for anything that's dead.

Daylene Long (27:28):

Okay.

Manuel Burgos (27:29):

You get the balance of the two right there. And anything that's going to, that chemistry wants, I'll get them from Flynn because they giving me my best price and the containers that come in with the MSD material data safety sheet with them and it comes in packaged correctly and they have a wide variety of chemicals that I can access and they have a big catalog. Those are the big three that float around in my mind whenever I'm looking for something. And worst case scenario, if I'm really pressed for time and it's something that the teacher really needs, then we'll punt and go with Amazon.

Daylene Long (28:16):

Okay. Does your school have a contract with Amazon?

Manuel Burgos (28:23):

We have an Amazon card that we get certain discount points. I don't know, I'm not quite sure how that works out, but I let them know that we can only get certain things from Amazon and they'll go ahead and order it for us, but they'll put it on their Amazon credit corporate card.

Daylene Long (28:44):

Okay. And did those happen one time a year with Amazon or did they happen throughout the year?

Manuel Burgos (28:50):

This case, it actually happened just once a year. Really it's, it's a freak thing. Normally it's like we can't get it from the initial vendor, so we end up having to punt and go ahead and get it from Amazon instead because it's just, we can get prime shipping. So we get it overnighted to us and it resolves. One of the issues I came up with was that they didn't have chloroform for one of the chemistry labs they were doing and they needed some pheno and they weren't able to get it from the normal vendor of Flynn, so they ended up having to get it from Amazon. Amazon was able to give it to us the next day. So it just worked out everything else we would get from them. Huh,

Daylene Long (29:49):

Okay. Do you have a preference for the companies that specialize in life sciences or is it really, I'm just trying to get a sense there. You said that you go to Carolina for everything, living and nassco for everything that's not living. How did you make that distinction? Because I think, if I remember correctly, NASSCO also has live specimens. I could be wrong and also has ones that are not alive

Manuel Burgos (30:22):

Well, they're always giving me all the dissection stuff. Everything in the back that they've used in the back is all dead. I haven't looked mean in their catalog here. I don't see anything that's living in the way of fishes or sea urchins. Everything is dead or skeletons teeth.

Daylene Long (30:48):

What about with Carolina? Do they have the specimens that aren't living?

Manuel Burgos (30:59):

They do have actually, we will go out to them and get kits from them that are the complete lab, but it's normally like it's a matter of do we actually have the materials that we can buy from the store ourselves or is it better off just getting the whole transcription lab from them or is it better just getting it just, we've gone from Caroline's, we've gotten plants and some seed pods, but we've never gone out to them for, and we get fish and we get sea urchins, but we've never gone to for bugs or roaches or anything like that or boll weevils or anything along those lines.

Daylene Long (31:53):

Okay. So you like the kits when it kind comes together, but what I understood was that you don't always need everything that's in the kit.

Manuel Burgos (32:02):

Correct.

Daylene Long (32:03):

Okay. Alright, that's good to know. With any of the vendors that you use, is there anything that they do that's unique that makes you go, okay, this is why I really like this vendor

Manuel Burgos (32:16):

With Carolina. I like the fact that they really care about the sea urchins, whatever they sent to us live, they'll send you the kit first and they'll give you a voucher inside of it and saying, okay, when you are ready for the live sea urchins or whatever it is, fish wises, give us a call and then we'll overnight ship it to you because we don't want, like you said, sitting outside waiting for it. And depending on where you're at for climate wise and weather and everything else, I like the fact that they actually care about getting the specimens to us alive as opposed to dead.

Daylene Long (32:58):

It's always funny when you're talking about the life sciences and you have to talk about the living and the dead and what you need. And there's also, yeah, it's always interesting to me. Let me see. So I would just want to flip through a little bit more and I want to kind of look forward now, so I think I have a good understanding of how you buy looking forward. We know that teachers are always being asked to do more with less and it just seems to increase each year. So are there any things that suppliers could do, build, expand upon that would help your teachers either in saving time or in delivering better science instruction?

Manuel Burgos (34:02):

I like the fact that let's say Carolina and Flynn and that they give us the labs already in a nutshell. And I mean they actually give us the actual handouts that come with the lab. The actual will be like they give you a teacher version with all the instructions and everything like that and what to look out for and they give you one for the students. So all you really need to do is just make a copy of it and give it to the student and say, okay, this is your lab, go ahead and go to it. So it simplifies the process of typing it up, finding the form, everything's already included in there, so it's just a matter of just making multiple copies of it and turning it, giving it to the student.

Daylene Long (34:57):

And did they give you a print copy or is it digital or how do you actually get those materials

Manuel Burgos (35:04):

Print? It was a print copy.

Daylene Long (35:07):

And that works for you with no issues on the print,

Manuel Burgos (35:11):

No issues whatsoever.

Daylene Long (35:15):

And do any of the vendors you work with have videos that they provide either for the students or for the educators on a lab?

Manuel Burgos (35:29):

Not that I've needed it. Not that I've needed to actually go, hold on a second. I take that back for Carolina, actually, I had to go to their website to find out about the sea urchin lab to figure out what I needed to do with the sea urchins because frankly it was the first time I ever had to hold a sea urchin in my hand and inject them with a needle and make sure I was doing it right, like all moving around the little tentacles and the little, so they look like little rocks. The other thing too is that I wanted to go back one on top of giving you a hard copy as well too. Some of 'em just give, you can actually have a link inside of their data that you can actually go back and refer to it. If you have additional questions about the lab itself, you can actually see the demo of the lab and Flynn is good about that as well too.

Daylene Long (36:27):

Okay. So the demo of the lab and that's in some sort of a video or is it,

Manuel Burgos (36:33):

It's normally like a link inside of the actual package. You can go to it and click on it.

Daylene Long (36:40):

What does the link take you to? Does it take you to a website?

Manuel Burgos (36:42):

It takes you normally to a YouTube video or something inside. The other thing as well too is if you go out to their website, they'll actually give you, actually give you the, let's say if I lost all of the paperwork and stuff like that. But I do know what lab I want to do. I can actually download the PDF format of that entire lab and pre-print it out if I need to.

Daylene Long (37:08):

Okay. And I forgot, which vendor did you say does that for you?

Manuel Burgos (37:17):

That was Carolina actually. Okay. That was for Carolina and Flint. I'm sorry? Both. I mean both of them do that. Okay.

Daylene Long (37:25):

Okay. That's helpful. I'm trying to think if there's just anything else that would be helpful either to your educators or to your students when you are getting your lab materials.

Manuel Burgos (37:48):

Well, when I get my labs, we did an egg diffusion osmosis lab in class and what I liked about it, and it kind of helped my students, was the fact that the data chart that you needed to obtain from the measurements and stuff like that was already on the paper. So all they had to do was just basically say, okay, I have it already there, the format's already there for me. I just have to fill in the information, get my data. And then there was an actual section on the backside which just had to plot. So it was all inclusive for them.

Daylene Long (38:37):

Okay. Do any of these materials or programs need to be able to play well with other programs on your computers? Do any of the materials you buy need to work with your LMS or any of those types of things or just not really come into play?

Manuel Burgos (38:59):

No, it doesn't come into play.

Daylene Long (39:01):

Okay. Alright. That sounds good. Kim, if you've got a minute, I want to bring you back in and see what questions that you might have. I think I've gone through all of the questions I have for Manuel.

Kimberly Herder (39:15):

Thank you. Just a question about the products working with the students. So do you feel like you need to make much accommodations or tweaking for what you get if you order a kit or you're ordering supplies? What's the level of change or instruction that you need to do to accommodate your students? What's your student base?

Manuel Burgos (39:49):

For my students, sometimes they just have to trim down certain procedures for them. And what I mean by that is I can actually take the, we only have 47 minutes, so we're locked in one amount of time that we have. So by the time they get set up and get started and get into the meat of it, we're coming up to the end of the class. So normally I end up kind of chunking it in pieces so that we can do procedure one today, procedure two, we'll pick it up tomorrow where you guys left off and we move procedure three to the next day or the day after that after you've had a chance to write up your notes and do part of your lab report. So I've ended up having to break up the lab. I don't know if there are specific time requirements on there to be done at the same time all in one order, but I end up having to break 'em up accordingly for my sea urchin lab that is like an eight day lab because you're actually expressing the gamut from the sea urchins. You got male and female sea urchins and you actually look under the microscope for them and you actually combine them and then you get to see the whole process of fertilization and then you go on to the different stages of cell division. So it's a week long worth of going back and reviewing it and seeing what's going on and making your notations of exactly what's going on with your specimen. For that time.

Manuel Burgos (41:34):

I've been able to work around these things and just be able to organize the students in such a way that I can chunk it easier for them. We'll do the expression of the gamt for the urchins and we'll do the mixing all in the same day, but then the time it only will require maybe about 15 minute slot of class time while we go ahead and update our notes and write down our observations for the class. It doesn't require anything more than that.

Daylene Long (42:05):

Is your school a private school? You mentioned the district earlier or is it like a magnet school?

Manuel Burgos (42:12):

It's a private school.

Daylene Long (42:13):

It is a private school. Okay. It's a

Manuel Burgos (42:15):

Private school.

Daylene Long (42:17):

You mentioned your district earlier though. Is there a district for the private schools or do you guys, how does that work?

Manuel Burgos (42:24):

We are a Catholic parochial high school.

Daylene Long (42:28):

Okay.

Manuel Burgos (42:29):

Okay. So we answer to the archdiocese of Palm Beach County.

Daylene Long (42:33):

Okay.

Manuel Burgos (42:35):

Okay. So when we do labs here, the emphasis is on not killing things. So like for sea urchins and for anything that we do with embryology or any other specimens, we do not, how you say this, we don't cause pain or suffering to the specimens regardless of whether or not they're sea urchins or they can actually scream or anything else like that. We try to be sensitive to the fact that these are living creatures.

Daylene Long (43:06):

Which is why you appreciated that from Carolina that they were caring for the sea urchins.

Manuel Burgos (43:11):

Correct. And as well too, we ended up setting up a salt water tank for them so that when we were done with their experiments, we were able to actually return them to a salt water tank and preparation be transferred back out to sea.

Daylene Long (43:27):

That's a nice circle that you're bringing in there. So because you're a private parochial school, do you guys have to make accommodations for students with learning disabilities or multiple languages that are spoken or remediation and acceleration, those types of things?

Manuel Burgos (43:49):

Yes, we do. We have five oh fours. We have IEPs of course I'm aware of who has an IEP who has accommodations in place already and I do, I have a smaller regular class that has those personalities involved in there. And normally I'm more hands-on with them when we do the labs. And for any individuals that require, how you say is additional help? I'm here till normally three 30, which is an hour after dismissal for them.

Daylene Long (44:31):

Okay. We've just got a few minutes left and we want to be respectful for your time. So is there anything else that you would want to, if you're talking directly to companies about what they should be developing or what is most needed in science education, is there anything you would like to share with us?

Manuel Burgos (45:05):

Just for the website, if they could kind of organize their labs a little bit more by topic area

Daylene Long (45:18):

To

Manuel Burgos (45:18):

Say by topic area. For example, if I go, I type in transcription, it doesn't show up on there, so I have to kind of ferret through their website to find the parts that actually make the lab work.

Daylene Long (45:40):

And there's not anybody that does that currently?

Manuel Burgos (45:44):

No, not at this time right now.

Daylene Long (45:47):

So it's topic you're teaching or the disciplinary core idea or the standards you're trying to meet, that type of thing that you'd like to be able to look it up by?

Manuel Burgos (46:00):

Yes. Yes.

Daylene Long (46:02):

That's helpful. Anything else that's a really good contribution I would think that that would be important to other teachers besides yourself?

Manuel Burgos (46:13):

No, and no. For example, like this catalog, I hate to say it, but I really prefer a catalog compared to sometimes just being able to just peruse it and just be able to find it. But I like the way, for example, not so much to be about these guys here, but I liked the fact that they broke it up into different departments on here. So it made it easy for me to just basically hand this over to my other departments and said, here, go see what you need out of this. And they were able to go flip to their section and just basically identify, okay, I need this, this is what I need and go from there.

Daylene Long (46:56):

So you still really like the hands-on catalogs and having it divided by department is helpful for you because you're a department chair, so when you're dealing with the different departments that you can just kind of say, okay, go look at your section.

Manuel Burgos (47:10):

Right.

Daylene Long (47:12):

Okay.

Kimberly Herder (47:14):

I'm going to follow ma'am just a little bit on that. I'm kind of thinking of the old toy Christmas catalog. Is there any time that you have had a chance to peruse the catalog and said, wow, that looks kind of cool, maybe we could do something like that instead of looking for something you talked about perusing have,

Manuel Burgos (47:34):

Yes. I mean I've been looking through this for my physics department. My physics teacher is a new teacher, so I've been trying to guide him with regards to activities that he could do with his students to not make the class so dry because most of the way he approaches it is through dry mathematical calculations. So that's why we've gone into, we've expanded upon with rocketry and a bunch of other little things just to keep the kids interested, to keep him motivated and locked in for the class and to actually give him a better appreciation of like, wow, this is how it really applies in the real world.

Manuel Burgos (48:20):

As I mentioned before, I work at a hospital, so a lot of my experiences in the hospital translate into the anatomy physiology class, AP biology class here, and my stories and my experiences and the stuff that I do in class, whether or not it be diffusion or osmosis or like a centrifuge where I spin up blood and stuff like that to show them the different layers, it keeps the kids engaged in the actual class itself. And a lot of them come into class going, my last class was so boring, I can't wait till you go to your class. And that's the difference. That's how we get them intrigued and actually engaged in there. So I do a lot of demos in class and I'm just trying to form that out to the other teachers as well too, to impress upon them that if you want the kids to react, you have to do something.

Manuel Burgos (49:25):

Just can't be simply talking and lecturing and saying, okay, here's a periodic table, I'm going blow something up. Really honestly, make a chemical reaction onto there. This year the kids go from biology to chemistry and they come to me for anatomy and physiology. So I explained to 'em, it's like you might think that chemistry is a foregone object in your life. I know how much you were looking forward to it, but guess what chemistry is going to be with you in this class as well too. And I showed them some basic reactions and stuff where hydrogen gas was released from the combination of product and chemicals and we set that on fire. So it was beautiful. Nice blue, magenta flame. They loved it. They're like, this is great. The room smells, but it smells great. It's great.

Daylene Long (50:21):

That's great. Well just one quick last question and then Kim, she'll walk you through the next steps, but you keep that Nassco catalog on your desk. Are there any other catalogs that you keep on your desk to reference?

Manuel Burgos (50:38):

Actually, I do have, and they're behind me though. So I have the Flynn catalog and I do have one other catalog that's over there by my filing cabinet. It's on the top of it. It's just a bigger book. It reminds me of the Sears and Roblox, the big huge monster catalog that you used to get.

Daylene Long (51:00):

Which one is the big one? Is it you've got Flynn and Nassco, do you have Caroline?

Manuel Burgos (51:07):

Yeah, and I have Carolina.

Daylene Long (51:09):

Okay. Alright. Well that sounds good, Kim, do you want to walk him through next steps in terms of what to expect?

Kimberly Herder (51:17):

Yes. Well first thank you. This has been fantastic. In the next day you'll be getting a follow-up email from me and with a attachment. Oh, we said we were sending you a Amazon $95 Amazon gift card. It's actually going to be Visa. Is that okay?

Manuel Burgos (51:36):

Sure.

Kimberly Herder (51:37):

Okay, good. All right. Just wanted to make sure on that. I also, if there's any thoughts, ideas that you think about in the future and maybe tonight I'm one who ponders things, please my information will be on there and go ahead and send that to me. That would be great. And then also if you're interested in, I'm making this call that if you're interested, we'd love to have you participate in future studies as well if you'd like. So just indicate on that as well. Came back. Sure,

Manuel Burgos (52:13):

Not a problem. Whatever. You guys need this side of the coin.

Kimberly Herder (52:21):

Well, I wish I was in your classroom so

Daylene Long (52:24):

I know. Oh,

Manuel Burgos (52:25):

I have a lot of my parents when they come in, they're like going, I wish I could come back to school and take your anatomy class. It sounds like so much fun because their kids go back home and they're like going guess what we did today?

Daylene Long (52:39):

That's awesome. Very good. Well thank you again and thank you for all that you do for teachers and students in science education and man, you've got a busy life working at the hospital on the weekends too. So we just really appreciate your dedication and want to acknowledge that you do make a really big difference other than just blowing things up and getting kids excited. It's wonderful what you do and we wanted to thank you for that.

Manuel Burgos (53:09):

Thank you.

Daylene Long (53:10):

Yeah. Alright, thank you so much. And you will get the gift certificate and I'll follow up email soon.

Manuel Burgos (53:15):

Alright, great.

Daylene Long (53:16):

Thank you. Bye-Bye. Take care

Manuel Burgos (53:18):

Now. Bye-Bye bye-Bye.

Daylene Long (00:03):

Okay. Who is our next interview with

Kimberly Herder (00:06):

Dawn Parker. She's a science teacher from McLaurin High School in Florence, Mississippi. She's biology, and right now it looks like she's taught other science courses in the past. She's also the assistant band director. She's a Carolina loyalist, but also refers to Flynn. She's been teaching for 20 years. Her school is considered a military star school through ROTC, meaning at least 30% of the kids belong to ROTC.

Daylene Long (00:46):

So she is ready to join us. Okay. Have anything else you know about her? Do you know generationally?

Kimberly Herder (00:53):

Yes. She's 65 to 80, I mean born in 65 to 80. Okay.

Daylene Long (00:59):

Gen

Kimberly Herder (01:00):

Donor's choice, and they've got 17.7 million to spend in ESSR. Money left. All

Daylene Long (01:08):

Right.

Kimberly Herder (01:23):

Hi, Don Parker?

dawn.parker (01:25):

Yes. How are you?

Kimberly Herder (01:26):

Good. I'm Kim Herder and I'm here with Daylene Long and with Catapult. Alex and Daylene is going to conduct the interview today as the researcher. I'm going to pop off eventually and be in the background, but we're very happy that you're here. Very happy that you're participating with us, and we want to learn all about what's going on at your school and hoping that you'll take a minute and tell us about yourself, and then Daylene will give you more instruction on how we're doing the next half hour.

dawn.parker (02:04):

Okay.

Daylene Long (02:06):

So tell us a little bit about yourself, Don.

dawn.parker (02:08):

Okay. Well, I started teaching in 2000. I was an assistant teacher before that for four years, and I've taught everything except fourth grade and kindergarten. Oh, wow. I'm kind of half music, half science. So I have taught elementary school. I've taught multi-age, elementary. I've taught band. I've been a band director and taught all the music type classes. I have been chemistry teacher and AP chemistry, and just about every science imaginable, forensics, genetics, ap environmental science, environmental science, earth and space, physical science. So all of those, the above. And I've done seventh and eighth grade writing just about everything.

Daylene Long (03:00):

And what are you teaching now?

dawn.parker (03:02):

Right now I teach forensics and earth and space, physical science, AP environmental science, and environmental science.

Daylene Long (03:10):

Wow, that's a lot. I'm the assistant band director and I do the FCA also. Okay. So I'm going to walk you through just a few things for our interview today, and then we'll just dive right in. Sound good?

dawn.parker (03:26):

Sounds good. All

Daylene Long (03:27):

Right. Okay. So first of all, we are recording today.

dawn.parker (03:31):

Okay.

Daylene Long (03:32):

It is just for note taking purposes. I promise you won't end up on YouTube and I'm not going to ask you to do a TikTok dance. And then, let's see. Just to remind you too, we're going to talk a little bit about, you had mentioned that you bought materials for life sciences in the last six months, so we're going to talk a little bit about that.

dawn.parker (03:59):

Our objective was really just to understand

Daylene Long (04:05):

Where we can make things better. What kinds of things delight you? What kinds of things frustrate you? We'll ask a lot of why questions. There are no wrong answers. There's no right answers. It's just your experience and it helps to think of it as Kim and I filming a documentary. So we'll ask you just a whole lot of things around the experience. We want to get a full understanding of where you are.

dawn.parker (04:44):

Okay.

Daylene Long (04:46):

So dive in for a little bit. You mentioned in your survey that you'd bought for life sciences in the last six months. Tell us a little bit about that, and when was the first time that you were like, oh, I need to start putting together an order?

dawn.parker (05:04):

Well, the very beginning of the year, I knew I would. I'm teaching something I haven't taught in about six years, and then I'm also teaching something I only taught once for a semester 10 years ago.

Daylene Long (05:17):

What

dawn.parker (05:18):

Science is something that is, like I said, I've only taught six years ago one semester,

dawn.parker (05:26):

And I didn't have a book, so I'm kind of like, I got to pull everything together real quick. And I'm also teaching physical science, which I haven't taught for about six years. And so I knew I had to get some things for it. So as far as dividing money and everything, I knew I was going to have to do that. With all the sciences I teach. I've only taught AP Environmental Science one other year. This is my second year, so I don't even have really everything I would consider my full library for it. And I can't use that same thing, the same material with my environmental science class because they very potentially have the ability to take my AP class the next year or year after that.

Daylene Long (06:08):

Yeah. So just for clarity, when you said the beginning of the year, you meant the beginning of the school year. Year. So when do you guys start school?

dawn.parker (06:18):

We start in August. You

Daylene Long (06:20):

Start in August. Remind me what state you're in?

dawn.parker (06:23):

Mississippi.

Daylene Long (06:24):

Mississippi. Okay. So in August you're thinking, okay, I've got to get some things together from my AP in environmental and my environmental and they can't be a lot of overlap. And then where did you go from there? So how did you decide what you wanted and who you wanted to buy from?

dawn.parker (06:46):

Well, I'm going to be real honest. I was audited once already for my EEF money. Just the P is the luck of the draw. And it was really easy audit wise because I had purchased previously everything, most everything through teacher pay teacher. And so they have a way you can print out everything you bought or purchased that year. And so that was a really easy turn in for me. And it's fast and it's easy and you've got it right there. We're on canvas, we put everything on Canvas. I have to pretty much have a digital copy of everything anyway, so it's really easy to, it really just, it lends itself to the canvas and they've got a lot of different things that are made for a digital world basically. And that's very helpful for me because of that.

Daylene Long (07:43):

Tell me a little bit more about this audit. So are you a science department chairperson or are you No,

dawn.parker (07:50):

Ma'am.

Daylene Long (07:51):

Okay. But you got an audit from the district or from the building? From the State, the

dawn.parker (07:57):

Right,

Daylene Long (07:59):

So they pick

dawn.parker (08:00):

A couple people per school every year to do an audit.

Daylene Long (08:04):

And what did they say? Turn over all your records? Yeah,

dawn.parker (08:08):

They ask for the receipts for anything that you've purchased with EEF money

Daylene Long (08:13):

And tell me what EEF money is.

dawn.parker (08:15):

It's the educational money that each teacher gets to spend each year.

Daylene Long (08:22):

Okay. And what's about your budget on that?

dawn.parker (08:26):

And it can range each year, but about 600.

Daylene Long (08:29):

Okay.

dawn.parker (08:30):

Anywhere from 300 to 600 most usually. So

Daylene Long (08:33):

You get the ugly gram that says, Hey, we want every little receipt you have to account for every little penny that you spent. And so you have good records on that. So for this new round for your environmental classes, then how did you come up with what you wanted for these new?

dawn.parker (08:56):

Well, after looking at exactly what I had to teach on my standards, I went ahead and I thought, well, I know teacher pay teacher's going to have something out there. And so I went ahead and get in that. And I'm a big literature teacher, I guess it's come from teaching elementary, and my school is admission right now is involving literature in just about everything.

Daylene Long (09:18):

And so I knew they had a lot of literature based things out there, and so I went ahead and just dove into environmental science and they'll pop up everything and just sort through and

dawn.parker (09:28):

Find the things kind age appropriate and that had literature basis and that kind of thing. So the only thing really, they do not have, because they have a lot of good activities for AP environmental science, and they've got a good literature type based stuff for environmental science, but the lab type stuff obviously is

Daylene Long (09:50):

A

dawn.parker (09:50):

Little different.

Daylene Long (09:52):

Yeah. So then how did you find what you wanted to do for the lab stuff?

dawn.parker (09:56):

I'm honest, I did not because this semester is it, and by the time the EEF money comes in September, it's difficult to wrap your brain around ordering that and trying to get lab-based stuff in there. So was my AP stuff was fine. I already had it set, but the environmental stuff was lacking because I just didn't have things to be ready for more than,

Daylene Long (10:27):

So then what do you do? I mean,

dawn.parker (10:29):

Yeah, you grow things and you do whatever you can do. You use those hand or those house found things. You take those, you rob from home and you bring it in. Okay.

Daylene Long (10:44):

Okay. That makes sense. So you really spent the majority of your budget coming up with the activities on teachers pay teachers, and you like the fact that they've got kind of an audit track for you so that you can turn those in for budgets and stuff?

dawn.parker (11:01):

Yes.

Daylene Long (11:02):

Okay. That sounds good. And then for some of the other classes that you in the past have purchased hands-on materials for, who do you think of and who do you like to buy from?

dawn.parker (11:16):

Carolina Biology.

Daylene Long (11:19):

Okay. A

dawn.parker (11:20):

Lot of the lab type stuff. I'm trying to think.

Daylene Long (11:24):

What kind of lab type of things do you get from They actually make the kits for physical science or

dawn.parker (11:31):

Just depending on the topic, they'll have a different lab kit for the different topics. Okay.

Daylene Long (11:35):

So you Like the kits

dawn.parker (11:36):

Chemistry? Yeah, the AP chemistry was really easy through them. And I'm trying to think, forensics, they have a few forensic things that are really good, and they have both the digital side and the actual hands-on materials, so that helps.

Daylene Long (11:52):

Oh, that's interesting. Tell me about that.

dawn.parker (11:56):

The digital downloads will come first, of course, but then they'll also ship you the labs and so you'll have both.

Daylene Long (12:03):

Okay. So the digital downloads, are those PDFs, are they videos? Are they what? Usually

dawn.parker (12:11):

They're like PDFs.

Daylene Long (12:12):

Okay. All right. So that gets you started while you are waiting for the print then

dawn.parker (12:18):

To come in?

Daylene Long (12:18):

Correct. Okay. Who else do you buy things from?

dawn.parker (12:23):

Oh gosh, this year. I mean, that was it.

Daylene Long (12:28):

Okay.

dawn.parker (12:28):

In the past, fries I've used, and I'm trying to think. Flin I've used when I taught chemistry and physical science, I used Flynn a lot.

Daylene Long (12:40):

Okay. Do you ever use Flin for the life sciences or is it mostly just physical and chemical?

dawn.parker (12:45):

No, It's just mostly been physical and science and chemistry.

Daylene Long (12:49):

Okay. That is helpful. Can you think of with any of the companies, you mentioned a time where you had a really great experience or conversely when you had an experience that was disappointing?

dawn.parker (13:07):

No, I've never really had a bad experience. Not through a company per se. I've wishlist some things and I received some things, and I don't know whether it was a company issue or if it was a central office issue or if I just got something secondhand or what, but they shipped me, I had a huge terrarium that I was going to use. It was like half aquarium, half terrarium. You could use the whole myo system there, and they had glued in the inset incorrectly. So

Daylene Long (13:43):

The

dawn.parker (13:43):

Actual things would, like the fish or the crayfish would get behind the little formation or the landmass formation, whatever you want to call it, and they would get stuck back there. So I don't know whether the company put it together. Like I said, it got shipped to me a little differently, so I don't think it was, I think somebody actually had it first and then sent it to me. So I don't know.

Daylene Long (14:04):

It was a wishlist thing. It wasn't something I ordered from a company. It was something that I had turned in saying, Hey, I would really like to

dawn.parker (14:11):

My county office, and that's what I got.

Daylene Long (14:14):

Okay. So do most of the orders go through the county office

dawn.parker (14:19):

On EEF cards? No.

Daylene Long (14:22):

Okay.

dawn.parker (14:23):

On wishlist stuff, if we really want something that we know we can't afford EF money wise, we can put in a wishlist to our science person and she usually tries to find it for us if she can get it.

Daylene Long (14:36):

Is it like a wishlist that's part of your district or your school that they put it together and it goes to the central office? Or do you wish list with companies or how does that work? We

dawn.parker (14:48):

Have a science curriculum person at central office and pretty much if we tell her, Hey, I'd really like to see if I can't get that, if she can find the monies, then she will try and check off those wishlist things.

Daylene Long (15:01):

Yeah, that's nice. Do you remember who the Terrarium Aquarium thing came from? No

dawn.parker (15:09):

Ma'am. It's been years ago

Daylene Long (15:12):

And it was shipped to me, like I said, it was shipped to me in a box that it

dawn.parker (15:16):

Didn't look like it was a company box. You know what I mean?

Daylene Long (15:20):

Little sucks. I

dawn.parker (15:20):

Think what it was was somebody got it and they knew I wanted one and this person didn't want it and it got shipped to me.

Daylene Long (15:27):

But you remember that fish getting stopped? I Remember it. I had poor little critters behind it trying to get out. Oh my goodness. Couldn't Get them out. Let's see. Let me flip through my questions a little bit. Okay. So just to recap on the budget stuff, you said it was five or 600, I can't remember how much it is you get Per

dawn.parker (15:53):

Yes, anywhere between three and six. Usually Three and

Daylene Long (15:55):

Six. Okay. Depends

dawn.parker (15:56):

On, there's some kind of mathematical thing that they do and

Daylene Long (16:00):

Figuring out how many teacher's going to get and that kind of thing, but it goes

dawn.parker (16:04):

To us.

Daylene Long (16:05):

But everything else goes through the wishlist that you send to the district person and then they figure out if they have fundings in one way or another?

dawn.parker (16:14):

Yes.

Daylene Long (16:16):

What if you need something simple? I don't know. You need two stirring rods or a beaker in the middle of the year. What would you do? We

dawn.parker (16:26):

Actually have labs that have all those things and we keep those pretty well stocked. Our department head usually makes sure that, and we'll help, we'll do an inventory every few years and say, okay, we need this, we need this, we need this. And then we'll get with our curriculum specialist and she usually will find us money to replace those things with.

Daylene Long (16:45):

Okay. The curriculum specialist is at the district level?

dawn.parker (16:49):

Yes, ma'am.

Daylene Long (16:49):

Okay. All right. So they keep your lab pretty well stocked so you don't have to worry about getting those things through the middle of the year. Okay, that makes sense. Let's see, I'm just flipping through my notes real fast to make sure we're getting to everything. Talk to me a little bit about where you find new ideas about things that you might want to buy, web catalogs, conferences, social media, what do you use?

dawn.parker (17:25):

I go to a lot of conferences. I just got back from Washington DC for the Research Science Research Society.

Daylene Long (17:34):

Oh, good.

dawn.parker (17:34):

And do that. And I get a lot of ideas from other teachers a lot of times there at convention, not necessarily even what they're talking about as the conference, but also just teachers sitting around and saying, Hey, what do you do for this? And that kind of thing. So I get a lot of it there. I do just on teacher pay, teacher just browsing. Sometimes I just browse there. There are other educators and their standards are there, and so if I can find my standards, that helps. And you can really narrow down what you want search wise and filter. And so it's just really easy to find things, especially little activities and things like that.

Daylene Long (18:15):

So that's one of the way you search, you kind of go in and you look at the Mississippi standards for teaching environmental science or teaching a topic like cell respiration, something like that. Okay, that makes sense. Then I can narrow down

dawn.parker (18:35):

The age group also and that kind of thing.

Daylene Long (18:39):

Good. And

dawn.parker (18:40):

I also have my favorite people, like teachers that actually do a lot of different things on TPT and they'll have a following so you can follow certain people or certain people that create those supplies. And then as you follow 'em, kind of pop up sometimes telling you, Hey, I've got this out there, that kind of thing.

Daylene Long (19:01):

Who are some of your favorite teachers to follow on? Teachers pay teachers? Oh, I'm going

dawn.parker (19:05):

To be honest with you. I am not good with names.

Daylene Long (19:08):

I have them starred and I can look at 'em and follow 'em, but I

dawn.parker (19:12):

Don't keep up with names. It's just I've got too many.

Daylene Long (19:18):

What about groups or communities and social media? Do you follow any of those?

dawn.parker (19:23):

Yes. My forensics and apes both have really good groups out there that give a lot of advice and information and even handouts and things like that.

Daylene Long (19:36):

Okay, that sounds great. And then, let's see. One of the things that we learned in the survey that you filled out was that it's important to teachers that a vendor be reliable.

dawn.parker (19:53):

Yes.

Daylene Long (19:53):

What is a reliable vendor mean to you? What are the components that make up reliability?

dawn.parker (19:59):

If they say, I can get it in a week, I can get it in a week if they're going to have it and not just, oh, it's back ordered, that kind of thing. And it's nice to know that when you go to the site or go to order, it's not a hassle. It's very easy to use and I'm going to be able to, I know when I go in to order, it's not going to be something that's going to take me a day. It's going to take me a couple minutes. I get it ordered and I know it's going to show up.

Daylene Long (20:32):

Okay. And you also had mentioned to recordkeeping, you want to be able to definitely

dawn.parker (20:42):

Have a record of It.

Daylene Long (20:43):

How do you prefer that it keep those receipts for you in case you get the dreaded audit?

dawn.parker (20:48):

Well, TPT, which is I think theirs is probably one of the best. It has a record of all my purchases, so I could go to it. I click on my name, I click on my purchases, and all of my purchases are listed right there, and I can digitally click on them and it pops up. So it saves it for me. So all my digital things are right there. Do any of the other vendors, like you mentioned,

Daylene Long (21:12):

Carolina and Fry, do any of them do that?

dawn.parker (21:15):

I don't think so because there's stuff I usually use the PO and everything for, so it's a little bit different. I don't know if they do or not. I'll be honest with you. I've never had to. I know when I had the audit, I had to become like, okay, I need to know how to get this. And I could have done it individually, but I thought now there's got to be an easy way for this. So I called them and said, Hey, is there any way I can get this printed for this year and want everything I've bought for this year? And they're like, oh yeah. And then really nice about that. And that's another thing I think TPT has that a lot of the things don't is customer service is really good and fast and you get somebody on the phone right away and there you solve your problem.

Daylene Long (22:02):

Okay. That's good. Oh, the other thing, since we're talking about compliance issues, for any of the things that you purchased for your life science courses, do you need to keep safety or usage records for anything? Do you have to keep safety cards or anything like that for either OSHA or a fire marshal For

dawn.parker (22:28):

Chemicals? We do. We have, and we actually have it on a disc in several different places. Just the different chemical, any kind of dangerous chemical type stuff or even, it really doesn't even have to be dangerous one. Anything you order from Flynn? We have that now. My kids have to pass a safety test to do their labs and stuff, so we keep a record of that. But other than that, really not really.

Daylene Long (23:01):

So it's on a disc, does that disc, You have a disc and a digital

dawn.parker (23:05):

Copy, just one that's uploaded kind of thing.

Daylene Long (23:09):

Okay. And who's responsible for putting those together?

dawn.parker (23:14):

Actually Flynn does it.

Daylene Long (23:16):

Flynn does it for you?

dawn.parker (23:17):

Yes.

Daylene Long (23:18):

Okay. And then if you're not going through Flynn, if you're getting some of the lab kits from Carolina or that type of thing, how does that work then for, They usually include a flyer that has whatever, any kind of

dawn.parker (23:35):

Warnings or our labels that we would need for that kind of thing.

Daylene Long (23:40):

But that's separate from your disc or your uploads. Okay. Lemme see. I'm just going to flip through my notes. Does your school have a contract with Amazon at all?

dawn.parker (23:57):

Yes,

Daylene Long (23:58):

They do. Okay. So how does that work if you need something from Amazon? There

dawn.parker (24:06):

Is, I don't personally use it. I just don't usually buy that much from Amazon, so I don't use it. But there is a special way we're supposed to go in and it's a special group price and everything, so it's a special way we have to go in and then we have to sign up for it and everything. And they send us all that at the beginning of the year. Amazon, and I'm trying to think, office Depot, and basically they have a contract with the school or with the district. And so district wise, they tell us to use this account if we're going to go through EEF and we do it that way. We get a special price and all that kind of thing.

Daylene Long (24:43):

And then so for the classes you're teaching this year, do you have any computer either simulations or videos or labs that you do to supplement and what do those look like?

dawn.parker (25:05):

Yes, we have gizmos.

Daylene Long (25:07):

You have gizmos? Okay.

dawn.parker (25:08):

Yes. Lab wise, I think that's probably going to be the biggest lab wise we have is

Daylene Long (25:15):

Gizmos that

dawn.parker (25:15):

We use

Daylene Long (25:17):

And do. And how do you use those with a lab?

dawn.parker (25:21):

Basically they're a digital lab, so they have the handouts, they have the vocabulary, they have the simulations where they can change things. It's interactive so they can change things and then answer questions and then change 'em again and answer. So it's basically them doing it in a lab, but it's all virtual.

Daylene Long (25:43):

Okay. And do you use it instead of a hands-on lab with it for makeup? How do you use Usually instead of it, especially if things like growing, there's

dawn.parker (25:57):

No way to grow something in two days or in a day or two hours. Whereas this allows us to see the growth and measure things and things like that that we wouldn't normally take weeks to do. So we can do it in an hour.

Daylene Long (26:13):

And then does that come through? The

dawn.parker (26:16):

District actually does buy our Gizmo account for us. The last, I want to say four or five years, they have went ahead and purchased Gizmo for us.

Daylene Long (26:27):

Okay. That sounds good. Let me see. The next part of this is really just thinking about what it is that I want you to pretend for a minute that in our little documentary that Kim and I are filming, that this goes directly to a bunch of heads of organizations that can make a difference.

dawn.parker (26:55):

Okay.

Daylene Long (26:56):

What is it that is missing for you in the classroom, either for you as a teacher or for students that you think should be developed?

dawn.parker (27:10):

Wow. I think especially for beginning teachers or teachers that are beginning to teach a certain subject. I mean, it doesn't have to be somebody straight out of school, but maybe even somebody that's been teaching like me and then all of a sudden are thrown a few days before school starts, oh, you're going to teach this kind of thing. Just even units put together. So you have more of, because you see the digital stuff for a unit and you see the, oh, well, here's a lab for teaching this concept, or here's this for that. But you don't see everything bundled together. You never see. And maybe even it would be very helpful to show, okay, here's the standards, here's the essential questions that you need to ask. Here's the I can statements and stuff like that. You don't see all that bundled together. Very seldom do you see anything like that.

Daylene Long (28:15):

So you'd want something that took, I want to make sure I'm not putting words in your mouth, but something that took a topic and I don't know, pick a topic, something. Sustainability. Sustainability.

dawn.parker (28:30):

Sustainability.

Daylene Long (28:31):

Okay. So you take a topic like sustainability and you put together what are the lamps that you can do? What are the simulations or digital resources that go with it? The

dawn.parker (28:43):

Vocabulary. The

Daylene Long (28:44):

Vocabulary,

dawn.parker (28:45):

The literature you can use, Literature you can use altogether

Daylene Long (28:49):

Where it's sent, maybe phenomena, that kind of thing. And then that's all kind of wrapped together is if you're teaching sustainability, Dawn, here are all the different sources you can use.

dawn.parker (29:04):

Right. Resources, even if it's just links to WebQuests and links to different articles and things like that. Things that you can choose from. I don't mean cookie cutter type stuff, but the choices out there for teachers that, okay, here's a lot of things that you can use and this is what each one of them covers and this is the standards that they cover and this is the essential questions you can ask. And that kind of thing.

Daylene Long (29:33):

There's

dawn.parker (29:33):

Nothing out there like that that I know of. Now you can go ahead and get, if you're buying a textbook, a lot of times the textbooks will have some of those things bundled up. Of course, they're not going to have the lab supplies and things like that unless you're actually buying labs from whatever place that is. And they'll have some of those kinds of things involved in there if you buy the kits or the workbooks and all that kind of stuff. But as far as like me, I rarely, seldom pick up a textbook. We rarely pick up a textbook. We're much more news-based and article based, like journal science news type stuff. So when I find literature, that's what I'm finding. I'm not picking up a textbook and saying, okay, read from chapter. So-And-So does so-and-So doing the word boxes instead of just like, okay, write your vocabulary definitions. We're doing things like that. And so for me, having it all bundled together and having some choices to say, okay, I want to use this and I want to use that, but I've got something better than for this thing, so I'm not going to use this one, and oh, I want to do that lab out of three.

dawn.parker (30:41):

That kind of thing.

Daylene Long (30:42):

So it's kick-starting things for teachers who might have adopted or adapted a new lesson that they haven't done before because teachers like yourself who've been doing this for a while, you kind of know, I want to use this resource here and this one here, but not that one. But would you also use this resource for new ideas if there were, okay.

dawn.parker (31:05):

Yes.

Daylene Long (31:06):

Okay. Anything else that you can think of either for you or for students?

dawn.parker (31:16):

I'm trying to think. A student graphic organizers are good. I use a lot of doodle notes and I think doodle notes are a good thing because that really graphically puts it out there and they can throw color in it and everything. There's lots of different ways to help remember things. I think more doodle notes would be a really great thing. I would probably put a little more advanced type doodle notes in some of 'em, because a lot of the ones I see are pretty basic. And I would like to see 'em more like a web map kind of doodle note instead of what I get. A lot of the ones I get are just, they're good, but they're just basic. They're not really things that we can really add on and add on and add on kind of thing.

Daylene Long (32:09):

Okay. That's interesting. What about, do you ever use videos to get kids ready for a hands-on experiment?

dawn.parker (32:18):

Yes. You

Daylene Long (32:19):

Do? And is it something that's prepping them for safety or what the lab's going to be like?

dawn.parker (32:27):

Both actually. Especially back when I was teaching physical science and things, well, I would actually show them depending on what lab it was, some of 'em, I don't want them to know what's going to happen, but some of 'em, I and those, I would actually show them, okay, this is the lab you're going to be doing. And even if I don't show 'em the entire lab, I'm going to show 'em the safety aspects of it. Especially like, okay, this is how you're going to pour this liquid into this one. You need to make sure you're not putting anything on the triple beam balance. Look how they did this and that kind of thing.

Daylene Long (32:59):

Okay. That makes sense. Do any of the vendors you use supply those to go with it? Can you get those from Fry Carolina or you

dawn.parker (33:09):

May be able to. I've never really looked. I usually have found things on YouTube, believe it or not, better usually, or either. I don't want to say Bill Nye, but that type of thing, there's several of them out there that actually do some pretty good labs that just you get to watch and see. And sometimes I'll just watch the lab. I mean, if I know we're not going to have time to do it all or we don't have supplies to do it all, we'll just watch the lab.

Daylene Long (33:35):

Okay. That sounds good. Let's see. Anything else you can think of in that category? And then I will turn it over to see if Kim has questions for us.

dawn.parker (33:51):

Notes wise. I'm going to fall back to this on those. I don't have time as a teacher to have my kids all write the notes. I have kids on so many different levels. Some that writing is atrocious, some that write beautifully, some that take 20 minutes to write two lines and some that can write 20 lines in two minutes. And it's very hard to give notes that way because while one person is taking forever, the others are sitting there board. And so close notes, there's something you don't find a lot of

Daylene Long (34:32):

Close notes that

dawn.parker (34:33):

Would be Yes, where they're just missing a word or line here and there. Excuse me. No worries. And those kinds of things, because for me it's just easier to print it and leave a few blank. But especially for beginning teachers and everything, they may not get into that. And then after you've done it for years, that's not a big deal. You print your notes up and you erase some stuff and print it, but a lot of new teachers and things like that may not have that already yet. And then

Daylene Long (35:11):

What about for to get kids ready for the state assessment? I think we talked to somebody else in Mississippi who said, you guys test biology? Oh

dawn.parker (35:22):

Yes.

Daylene Long (35:24):

In high school. So how do you get the kids ready for the assessment? And is there anything missing there that would help you as a teacher or them as a student? I

dawn.parker (35:35):

Don't actually teach biology, but I have actually helped with, we at one year or two did a bootcamp

Daylene Long (35:47):

To

dawn.parker (35:47):

Where we would take them in different rooms and they would alternate the rooms. So they'd go from this one to this one, and you would literally feed them like 15 minutes of this topic. I had the chemistry aspect of that topic.

Daylene Long (36:03):

Interesting, Like the properties of water or something like that. And so we went from

dawn.parker (36:09):

Place to place to place, and they took, it was basically a day of going from place to place to place, getting those different topics and reviewing all those different topics.

Daylene Long (36:19):

That's an interesting way to do it. I haven't heard of anybody do it that way.

dawn.parker (36:23):

It was, I think, effective just because if nothing else, it just brought everything back up for 'em. And you couldn't do that in a hour, hour and a half class. And I think they enjoyed going from room to room. It wasn't a normal everyday thing.

Daylene Long (36:39):

Yeah. And my last question for you before I turn it over to Kim is are there any vendors that you consider yourself to be loyal to?

dawn.parker (36:48):

Oh, teacher pay teacher.

Daylene Long (36:50):

Okay. All right. Richard Flynn, like I said, when

dawn.parker (36:55):

I was teaching physical science, and now that I'm teaching physical science, again, Flynn probably was really good for that. You didn't worry about your stuff being broken and you didn't worry about things not coming in on time and that kind of stuff. So they were really good.

Daylene Long (37:10):

Okay. So that says to me that your loyalty's kind of wrapped up in the reliability aspect. Is there anything else that makes you particularly loyal to a vendor?

dawn.parker (37:20):

Price. Price is important. You got to make every dollar stretch.

Daylene Long (37:24):

Okay. All right. That sounds good. Kim, do you have any questions for Don?

Kimberly Herder (37:34):

Yeah, I'd like to follow up on your talking or I would call it scaffolding or accommodations in your classroom. And it sounds like you are writing those or how Closed

dawn.parker (37:51):

Notes, is that what you're talking about?

Kimberly Herder (37:53):

Actually, yes. I mean that's what sparked it for me. But was in your differentiating, do you plan for it differently? Do use, I mean, when you've used kits, is that an important part that's in there, or, I'm sorry.

dawn.parker (38:12):

I usually have, because I teach a lot of the general sciences, like the earth and space kind of thing, and environmental science things, I usually have a very large, not over the top, not anything I shouldn't have, but a large number of special education students. And so yes, I try to peer tutor them, try to get them, we do a lot of group work and partner work, and I try to partner them with somebody that I know will not just give 'em the answers but help them along. And I try to give them either a specific job to do when the group work that I know that they'll be successful at kind of thing. And the close notes do help with that, especially because it's all right there and a bunch of mine are already pulled for a special class that they have to catch up with everything. And so I talk to that teacher a lot as far as helping them and what they need and that kind of thing. And everything, like I said, is on Canvas so that teacher can get to all of that stuff and they can watch those videos if they need to over and over again, and they can pull out those notes or have anything that's on there. So that's helpful for them.

Daylene Long (39:27):

Okay. Kim, would you like to walk Dawn through next steps for us?

Kimberly Herder (39:33):

Yes. Well, first, thank you very much for doing this. You're welcome. And thank you for everything you're doing in the classroom for kids, for the school, and having taught anything they seem to need to have filled in at the moment that they School syndrome.

dawn.parker (39:50):

Yes, yes,

Kimberly Herder (39:51):

Yes. Well, this afternoon you'll get well this evening for you this afternoon for me, an email, sorry, thanking you. And then also there'll be a couple of questions in there. One of 'em being, if you would be interested in participating in something like this again, just to let me know. And then also if there in the next, this afternoon, this evening, the next couple of days, next week or so, you think of something else that maybe the wishlist bar, whatever it is that came to mind that you would like us to pass on or more information on. Something that you highlighted that you talked about. Alright,

dawn.parker (40:36):

Thank you.

Daylene Long (00:33):

Mark, can you hear me? Hi

markniebojeski (00:45):

There.

Daylene Long (00:46):

Hi. Well, my name says, or my thing says I'm daily and long, but I'm not. I'm Kimberly Herder and being the last day before the holiday for so many schools, it ended up to be one of those days that we are dividing and conquering. So if that's all right and thank you so much for switching the times and Sure,

markniebojeski (01:16):

No problem.

Daylene Long (01:16):

You accommodate us. So I am Kim Herder and I am a research coordinator for Catapult X and we have a client who is interested and motivated to make part of the marketplace be more receptive to teachers and their students in the life sciences programs. So going and Daylene Long is our chief researcher, but like I said, I'm going to do this one. If there's something that I forget, Daylene may be sending you an email, but I think we're going to be good. I'm going to tell you a couple things as we start off that this is being recorded, but it's only for note taking purposes. You're not going to end up out on YouTube or anything else and you won't need to perform for us or any of that kind of thing. So it is truly just for our note taking to make sure that we get what you say correctly.

(02:32):

You are going to find that I will be asking some questions that may seem like why is she asking them? And we've decided that really if you think about this as if I'm doing a documentary on the process of what teachers and administrators go through or do to make decisions on what's going to be happening in the classroom, looking at it from how you work, what this district requires and what is good for your students. So let's see if there's anything. I think I haven't forgotten anything yet. So what I'd like to do first is just have you take a minute or so and tell a little bit about you and what you're doing right now and your experiences as a teacher in sciences.

markniebojeski (03:27):

Great. Well, let's see. Mark Zeki, this is my 30th year, that's three zero teaching. All of it's been in the same district in Perth Amboy, New Jersey. I started off in the middle school for nine years and now 21 years at the high school. I've taught a myriad of different things from a little bit of chemistry, a little bit of physics, a little bit of earth science, biology, both at the college prep honors and AP level environmental science at the college prep and AP level. I also this year have a couple of classes in our health sciences academy where I am an emergency medical responder instructor, so the students I have in June pass an exam and get a certificate and they can go work for a paramedic squad or a doctor's office or an EMT squad We're when they're 18. What else? I know I still love what I do. I wouldn't be doing it for 30 years if I didn't.

Daylene Long (04:24):

Yes. Okay. Well I am going to, okay, I'm going to start with probably where I probably shouldn't but okay. Tell me a little bit more about, is this ACTE course then or is that funded by, okay, so tell me a little bit more about how that started, why you're doing it and that sort of Thing. A couple years ago the district decided to have

markniebojeski (04:47):

Focus academies and I started with a communications academy. Then I went to a health sciences academy. The health science academy has two tracks to it. One is a medical field track, one is a physical therapy and sports medicine track. I'm in the medical field one, the course is a senior level capstone course. It's a culmination of everything they've done in the Health sciences academy and it was done to give students something that if they choose not to go into a traditional college career, they could go into a medical field, get an associate's degree or like I said, start working at 18 with either an emergency medical squad, a paramedic squad, even the medical transports that take patients back and forth from nursing homes to hospitals to daycare, that kind of thing as just a way to get another route to getting a career started.

Daylene Long (05:40):

It's fantastic. I applaud you that Amazing. And a

markniebojeski (05:44):

Lot of it is being funded and partially run with the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, Barnabas Health System. I forget their whole long moniker. They combine so many different things, but they partially the program and oversee some of what we do.

Daylene Long (06:01):

So the funding for the other part is then out of district or out of school budget?

markniebojeski (06:08):

Correct.

Daylene Long (06:08):

Okay. Now for the kids to get that point, I'm going to step back to, so probably starting in this health sciences track, it's biology or how do they start off and

markniebojeski (06:22):

Okay, right now it's going to change in another year or two. They're opening a new high school and they're redoing the whole sequence of events. Right now the students start off with a physics class as a freshman, then they take chemistry, then biology and then electives as their seniors. Now in the Health Sciences Academy, I think they skipped the physics. They do chemistry, biology as freshmen, sophomore, and then they start more of the core health science classes as juniors and seniors like dynamics of healthcare, public health, the EMR class, that kind of thing.

Daylene Long (07:02):

Anatomy and physiology, that part. Anatomy, Physiology. Yep. Okay, Okay. And you teach some of those classes as well or have taught?

markniebojeski (07:12):

I said I do the MRI did have anatomy classes in the past. I still have biology this year in the regular generic population of the school. And then the EMR classes too?

Daylene Long (07:24):

That's a few preps.

markniebojeski (07:26):

It's three.

Daylene Long (07:27):

Okay. All Right. But I'm used

markniebojeski (07:29):

To it. I've done five at one point. So Raise

Daylene Long (07:33):

You. So thinking about the biology, let's go to that one and your curriculum is that, so one of the goals of this is to find out how to make your job easier from suppliers and saying, okay, I'm teaching biology. This is what I'm going to teach in it. This is where I'm going to go get my stuff. I'm interested on how you go through that process.

markniebojeski (08:04):

Our curriculum was recently revamped to reflect the N-J-S-L-A standards for science and as teachers we sat down and we made the curriculum campus with Go-to must do labs and activities, most of which we get from suppliers such as Carolina Biological or Ward Scientific or Fisher Bio-Rad is another one we use and a lot of the materials are, they're like pre-made kits that we get that have everything in it, just open it, hand it out and go kind of things

Daylene Long (08:45):

On the kits. Well apparently if you're continuing, can you tell me a little bit about the kits and how you decided to get used those?

markniebojeski (08:55):

We just found kits that meet the standard. We're trying to teach and have everything self-contained rather than have to buy 25 different things if there's one kit that has the majority of stuff in it that we can use and maybe supplement if we need to. We just went with that and for the basic or concepts that are in the standards, we try to find one really good activity for each of those standards that we could get as a kit just for simplicity's sake basically. And

Daylene Long (09:25):

Then when you order them, do you just tell me about the ordering process once you've met and you decided this is what you want to get, what happens? How does that happen?

markniebojeski (09:35):

Well, we get a list of approved vendor, I forget what they call it, approved vendor items from our district, from our instructional leader, and we go through and check off a box for what we need. If there's something, if there's a kit we want that's not on the list, we can write it in as a supplemental purchase and then we turn the list of supplies over to our instructional leader. They input it into some database somewhere. It scans through and finds the lowest contracted bid kind of thing. And then if it's not exactly what we want, if there's something of a comparable price or a slightly more affordable price that's a comparable item. We'll end up getting that. And then so we do all that in March and then hopefully, fingers crossed and pray that whatever you want to pray to, the stuff comes in by September, October usually.

Daylene Long (10:31):

Okay, and is there a couple of things? Do they give you a budget ahead of time?

markniebojeski (10:37):

We do not have a budget. I mean there is a budget for the science department. We're not privy to what that is and how much we can spend.

Daylene Long (10:45):

I'm not sure. I know some schools like each teacher gets

markniebojeski (10:48):

A thousand dollars or $500 to play with.

Daylene Long (10:51):

That's

markniebojeski (10:51):

Not how it works. Where I work, it's give us your wishlist. We'll order the stuff and what comes in will fit if we can't because it's too expensive or cost prohibitive or sometimes for the AP bio classes, there's very specific equipment like a mass spectrometer you need for one of the labs or something like that. They'll question like, well, why do you need this? And you just come up with a justification as to why you need it. If it's something that's in your curriculum you're supposed to teach and we don't have it, then they'll order it. If it's something you just would like to have because it's kind a cool, neat thing to have sitting in the background with the lights and whatever blinking, then they'll say no.

Daylene Long (11:28):

Okay. Pretty straightforward.

markniebojeski (11:31):

Right.

Daylene Long (11:33):

Okay, so let's talk about those kits for a second. Do you need to differentiate or just tell me about, think of a kit or let me know of a kit that you use and what you liked and didn't like about it and what you had to do with it?

markniebojeski (11:49):

Well, I know there's one, I believe it's from Carolina Biological that goes over photosynthesis and cellular respiration

Daylene Long (11:58):

And

markniebojeski (11:58):

It comes with everything you need. What we have to supply is spinach leaves a fresh consumable kind of thing, but all the chemicals, the glassware, the prep trays, the instructions for student manual and teacher manual is altogether, it's right there. You just open the kit up. Everything is portioned. They're designed for, I believe groups of 30 students working in groups of five.

(12:25):

So you have enough supplies to divvy it up like that. It's just very easy. It's very simple. It's no nonsense. It's all right there. When it comes in, we run on the outside of it in big marker. What it is, what unit it goes with. It goes in our storage room. When time comes to need it, you go get it, you take it back to your room, do what you got to do. If there's anything left over, it goes into a special location as if it's something that's not perishable, we keep it. Then for next year or so, maybe for the next year, we just have to order the chemical refill kit, not the whole kit that has all the other equipment and whatnot with it.

Daylene Long (12:59):

Okay. All right, and does that come with professional PD with it or how did you first learn how to do it?

markniebojeski (13:11):

Ooh, well, I've been doing this for 30 years. It was originally, I just grabbed the box, opened the teacher's manual, read it, okay, this makes sense. Try one year with the students, figure out what works, what doesn't, so that next year I can remember, okay, this didn't work well, I'll have to do it a little differently or this worked great and make sure I do this. There wasn't any kind of formal PD from anyone who sat down and said would walk you through, here's the kid, here's how you do it. Have all the teachers sit together, try it ourselves. I know some places do that nowadays, but where I work, it's more just new teachers come in, they'll ask the veteran teachers, what do we do here? Well, here we did this, it worked, try it this way. That kind of thing.

Daylene Long (13:54):

Okay. What about for students or is there videos involved in it or would that be helpful if there was or

markniebojeski (14:03):

Nowadays with everyone YouTubing, everything they do, you can find usually a video that goes with the lab you're doing. I'm not formally aware of any company that has a lab that goes with their specific, I mean a video that goes with their specific material, but I know other teachers have recorded what they've done and put it out there. What I usually do, since I've had mostly the college prep and honors classes lately, I'll give them the student copy of the lab the night before and their homework is to read over it and become familiar with what they're going to be doing, and there's usually some pre-lab questions or I'll make a couple of pre-lab questions to see if they did actually read it or just saying yes to say yes. And then the day of the lab, I'll have the materials set out in one specific location in the room if possible, grouped into group A, here's your tray of stuff, group B, here's your tray of stuff, everything you need, if it can be broken up that way. If not, I'll have, there's a part A to the lab, here's all the materials for part A, get what you need, go back to your lab table, work on it, return it, then go to part B.

Daylene Long (15:11):

Do you generally get your lab kits from the same vendor?

markniebojeski (15:16):

Yes.

Daylene Long (15:17):

And who's Our

markniebojeski (15:18):

District uses the same vendors. Like I said, the lab kits generally for biology come from either Carolina or Wards.

Daylene Long (15:24):

Okay, okay. You think or do you know if the school district has a contract with them or? I

markniebojeski (15:36):

Don't know if there's a contract per se, but I know they're always talking about the approved vendor list, and if you find a company that's not on the approved vendor list, you can't order from them unless it's something really unique, one of a kind that only they have.

Daylene Long (15:48):

Okay, So they

markniebojeski (15:49):

Keep steering us back toward the companies we've always used in the past?

Daylene Long (15:52):

Yes. Yeah. Oh, I thought of something. Now, when the kits arrive, what's the best experience you've had or the worst experience you've with them?

markniebojeski (16:10):

Well, the best is when they arrive in one piece and nothing's broken

Daylene Long (16:14):

And they arrive on

markniebojeski (16:14):

Time too.

Daylene Long (16:16):

On time helps.

markniebojeski (16:17):

A couple years ago with the whole pandemic and whatnot, when we got back into going in-person school, it was January when we got some things that we should have gotten in September because the way orders were backed up and whatnot. Worst experiences As far as with the kits, I could say I have a bad experience. I mean maybe sometimes something comes like if there's a glass bottle, it's been broken just because of a rough handle in shipping. My biggest complaint with a lot of the way things get shipped is the overpacking waste, shall we say. We got a box that was the size of, I don't know, the honor bridge, the Oxford dictionary, you know how big that is,

Daylene Long (17:01):

And it had

markniebojeski (17:03):

Three little packs of microscope slides in it and all this air bubble wrap around it just oversizing the packaging for a small thing or throwing chemicals with glassware with paper products in one box and not really sure what's in the box until you go digging through it. But as far as the kids themselves, a couple of times you've had kids come where things were broken through, probably rough handling somewhere along the supply chain, but other than that, nothing really wrong with the kit themselves, just the way we get them sometimes, the way they're packaged with other things.

Daylene Long (17:38):

You just said chemicals that remind. Do you for your OSHA or fire department or whatever, need to keep a list of chemicals that you have on hand or how does that Work? We do

markniebojeski (17:50):

As things come in, we do have a folder for all the MSDS papers. There is a central file in our storage room where we have to catalog in the kit and what chemicals are in it, and then a location of where it's being stored. If chemicals come in separately, like for the chemistry labs that are not part of a kit, but they order something in a large quantity, we do have a folder where all it gets written down and where it's located and when teachers need to use it, they have to sign out their names, the date, the quantity they're taking, when they return it, if there's anything they return or if there's none returned, it's been all used up, that kind of thing. We do have the proper storage cabinets, the flammable cabinets that are metal. We've got the wooden ones for the acids and whatnot, whatnot other. So we do have, it took a little while, but we finally got that worked out and running smoothly over the last two years I would say.

Daylene Long (18:45):

So it sounds like something, I don't want to put words in your mouth that your school came up with is not something that the vendor provided?

markniebojeski (18:52):

Not vendor provided, no.

Daylene Long (18:54):

Okay. We had

markniebojeski (18:55):

A group come in who does,

Daylene Long (18:57):

I

markniebojeski (18:58):

Guess they come and do safety inspections. I forget what the name of the company is, but they had a lot of recommendations of things that weren't quite stored properly, correctly fix it, and we spent a lot of time going through and taking one room that used to be a small classroom, redoing it as a storage room for all the science supplies, and in the middle of it are the metal containers that are the flammable ones that are for chemical storage, and we've got the wooden containers for acids and bases and the alcohols I think, and everything is labeled and cataloged and we're trying to stay on top of, so the next time the guy comes back, he can look in the door and go, yeah, it looks good. That kind of thing.

Daylene Long (19:38):

Would it be advantageous if when the box showed up that it said those things that you had a list of those things

markniebojeski (19:50):

On the outside of the box or paper stuck to the outside Or inside? Yeah. Okay. Well, because sometimes the kits are come in a cardboard box and they're shrink wrapped

Daylene Long (19:58):

Until you open the shrink wrap and open the box. You're not sure exactly what's in it.

markniebojeski (20:03):

If there was a paper put in with it or something, so you didn't have to open up the shrink wrap and say, in this kit you have X, Y, Z chemicals and the storage codes for them, that would be very helpful. I know most of the kits, the chemicals are in such small quantities and I guess harmless concentrations, for lack of a better word there

Daylene Long (20:26):

That

markniebojeski (20:26):

They can stay together in the kit and just be put somewhere. But again, it would be nice to have something on the outside of the box or a set of paper we could put on the cabinet with those kits to say, this kit has this in it, this kit has this in it, so we'd know exactly where.

Daylene Long (20:42):

Is there anything else you can see being helpful on the outside of the box?

markniebojeski (20:51):

For me, being a visual person, a picture of what is inside the box on the cover of it, a lot of the boxes from Carolina, they're white with some blue lettering. It says Carolina Biological, and there's a sticker on one end that just has the product number and the name of what the lab is. In the past, we have gotten from other vendors where the top of the box has a picture of it set up on a lab table so you can see what's in the box without having to open the box kind of thing.

Daylene Long (21:19):

Does that, when you just said, remind me when they did that, did it say what standard or anything that lab addressed or does that matter?

markniebojeski (21:32):

I know on looking at the websites,

Daylene Long (21:36):

They

markniebojeski (21:36):

Usually have that listed on the website, but actually on the box itself when you get it, no, there's no standard listed there.

Daylene Long (21:42):

Would that matter?

markniebojeski (21:45):

I don't think so.

Daylene Long (21:46):

Okay. I was saying if we're dreaming,

markniebojeski (21:49):

I mean to make things go quicker, for some people it might, for me personally, it wouldn't matter, but some people might find that helpful.

Daylene Long (21:58):

Okay. When you talk about safety or whatever in the classroom,

markniebojeski (22:04):

Is

Daylene Long (22:04):

There, how's the prep for the students and is there anything that the vendor could provide that might make that easier?

markniebojeski (22:13):

From what I've seen, the vendors are pretty good with having in the very front of both the student booklet or the student handouts and the teacher one, the safety code indicators as far as whether you need goggles, gloves, apron, which as an acid, make sure you have an acid spill set, clean up, whatnot. So that seems to be pretty well covered from what I've experienced.

Daylene Long (22:34):

Okay. My youngest son is deaf. He's a national merit scholar. I mean really, really bright, but deaf.

markniebojeski (22:46):

So this question is always

Daylene Long (22:48):

Comes from my heart on accommodations. How are you in your classroom for whether it's language or scaffolding, how do you address that?

markniebojeski (22:57):

I know as far as the language, we do have separate bilingual classes for science and they always try to get kids that have a Spanish component for the student handbook, the student manual for the lab. In mixed classes where we have students with different levels of learning or learning disabilities, there is another teacher in the room that helps out an in-class support and we can usually modify the lab so it's not as intense or in depth or if it's something that could be dangerous potentially we'll do it as a demonstration and have the students just observe what happens. So we do make accommodations based on whatever the student needs are as best we can for that activity.

Daylene Long (23:49):

I'm going to ask about assessments. So New Jersey, tell me what you're thinking and what you have to do. How are you going to be,

markniebojeski (24:04):

Let's see. I have to work another five years at least. Yes, And

Daylene Long (24:08):

Biology is a big year for that, isn't it?

markniebojeski (24:12):

But I know, okay. Over the past few years, the biology end of course, assessment exam or whatever name they give it nowadays

Daylene Long (24:20):

Is

markniebojeski (24:20):

More of a process, not a detailed information kind of test.

(24:29):

From what I've seen, a lot of the questions are more, it's more if you can read the statement and look at a chart or a graph and interpret it so it's not really minute detail, it's more like a topical idea, like an overview of something as opposed to prepare a wet mount slide and stain it with this stuff and it's just I get why they're doing it. It kind of levels the playing field more because not everyone has access to full laboratory stuff, but if they can get the basic concepts and understand if A happens and B happens, what could happen with C or in general, this is a thing we've seen predict what will happen in the future if the condition is remain the same. Now from a personal standpoint, I know it hasn't really counted much as far as the graduation requirement yet, and a lot of the students know that, so they don't really take it seriously unfortunately. But those that do take it seriously because they're just driven that way seem to wish it had more content specific stuff, not just the general topic idea, umbrella approach I guess. So it used to be when they had the grade eight proficiency test and the high school proficiency test, those things were more memorization and can you remember this with some application to it. Now it's just more if you can read and be rational thinker, you can answer these questions.

Daylene Long (26:10):

What does your class period look like? How long is it? How often do you meet? That kind of thing.

markniebojeski (26:17):

We have 42 minute class periods

(26:20):

For the sciences. We meet six periods a week, so we have four days of a single period, one day of a double period for doing lab activities. Next year that's going to possibly change to more of a block schedule because the problem now is if you're doing something, your lab day doesn't always fall. When you are ready to do a lab for a topic, you may have a lab on Monday and then have to introduce it on Tuesday and explain this because the way the schedule is set up next year it'll be more organic. Hey, we can do a lab tomorrow, let's do it because we'll have the time. That kind of thing. We have a 42 minutes students come in, we have a little do now activity, introduce a topic, have the students work on something, have an exit activity at the end and off they go.

Daylene Long (27:07):

How often do you do labs?

markniebojeski (27:09):

Right now, like I said, it's normally once a week when we have a double period, unless there's something that can be done in a 42 minute class period or let's real like 35 minutes as a demo or a short little activity, then we do 'em more often if possible. There's a lot of projects and research-based things that go on where the students are given a topic and you tell them, because we have very fortunate to have a one-to-one Chromebook student ratio. So I can give 'em a topic and say in 30 minutes, here's four questions, give me some information, go do it, come back the whole thing. They can design their own labs too, sometimes have 'em more later on in the year, once they're more used to it, give 'em a one day period to design a lab that they could then do on the lab day that goes with the topic we're covering.

Daylene Long (27:59):

Okay, cool. So what kind of supplies do you keep? What are your consumables and what are your fixed things? Do you have probes, scales? What's in your classroom?

markniebojeski (28:14):

Well, let's see, a few, many years ago they bought a bunch of veneer probes but never bought the equipment to hook 'em up to. So we have probes that can go nowhere. Now. Let's see what else. We have the usual microscopes, both regular light microscopes and dissecting microscopes. Every room has an incubator slash oven in it if needed. Glassware, we got lots of glassware, beakers, flask, graduated cylinders, test tubes, and then whatever comes in the kits that we can keep that UCF year after year, there's syringes from one. We'll keep those. If there's little well plates for mixing things, we'll keep those. That's pretty much it. Like I said, mostly glassware. The microscopes pretty much what everyone has in their rooms.

Daylene Long (29:09):

And then if something breaks and that kind of thing, do you keep a list and pass it on or how do you do that?

markniebojeski (29:16):

When glassware breaks, we keep a record of it and we've got such a backup in our storage room that you can just replace it with no problem. As of right now, as far as the microscopes, if something happens to one of them, they have to find the guy who knows how to fix 'em

Daylene Long (29:31):

And

markniebojeski (29:33):

Here go fix it. Because when I started they had an outside vendor would come in once a year to tune up everything and one day I just watched what he did and I can do this as needed. I said it to the wrong person like, oh, you can do as needed. Well guess what?

Daylene Long (29:47):

Here's another thing to add to your resume.

markniebojeski (29:50):

But I don't mind. I've fixed a lot of the microscopes. If it's something that I can do easily or if there's two that are broken but they're broken differently, cannibalizing into one that works kind of thing, as they got older, we'd replace 'em. If things are out of my scope of being able to fix, there is still a vendor they have that can come in and twice a year they can bring 'em in and he can work on whatever needs to be majorly done. Like I said, with the glassware, we try to keep a record of if something breaks and just we have, like I said, a big supply of extras to pull from.

Daylene Long (30:30):

And do you know when you need to have a new microscope or whatever, where it gets ordered from? How does that happen?

markniebojeski (30:40):

New scope if we need them when we do the ordering process in the springtime, I believe those come from Wards, scientific Ward Science where we've been getting the microscopes from recently.

Daylene Long (30:53):

Yeah, kind of on that, in that vein, do you ever get any swag or anything surprise you come in from when you get something new and they've thrown something else up in or would you like that to?

markniebojeski (31:04):

Well, I know one time I opened the box and there was a dead cockroach inside. Was it supposed to be dead? I have no idea. It was other stuff and it must've crawled in the box and they taped it up and would a little freebie be nice? Sure, why not? Everyone looks free things.

Daylene Long (31:23):

What would you want

markniebojeski (31:27):

A preview of a different lab that's similar to one we're ordered in the same kind of context maybe for the microscopes, a little cleaning kit that has lens papers and brushes and little Allen wrenches for tightening up things to become loose over time, that kind of thing. A coloring book. I don't know. Just something.

Daylene Long (31:53):

Well, your first couple. Well, besides the cockroach. Yeah, the other two are really good ideas. But on that line, do you do dissections?

markniebojeski (32:05):

The anatomy and physiology classes? Do? Our biology has moved away from that. We used to. It's now more of a molecular based and not so much organismal but in the anatomy physiology. And we do have a marine biology class. They still do dissections. Do

Daylene Long (32:22):

You have any idea where they get their stuff from?

markniebojeski (32:28):

I think it's Carolina Biological Display is where they get their specimens from.

Daylene Long (32:34):

And then I was going to ask you if you know they arrive alive or dead, but that's not your department.

markniebojeski (32:40):

They'll arrive dead, some are died, some are not died. They'll have the newer, less cancerous, toxic nesty smelling chemicals to preserve them kind of thing.

Daylene Long (32:49):

Yes, yes. That made me think of something else, but now I lost it. Okay. It was dissection the cockroaches. How about manipulatives? Things that may not be in the meaning. Do you use other hands-on things?

markniebojeski (33:07):

We do a lot of things. Some of those are more things that we find print and make ourself like for doing enzyme reactions. It's a sheet print on card stock, the students color in the different parts, cut 'em out and move 'em together, that kind of thing. There's another set, I don't recall who makes it, but they are thick like craft foam pieces to do DNA replication and protein synthesis where you put it together and it's a large kit. I mean the pieces are probably for the nucleotides almost two inches long and they go together like a zipper and you pull it actually through the ribosome that separates it. We can then put in the transfer RNA and whatnot. I forget who makes those. I know I found that someone had posted a video of them online probably eight or nine years ago and I showed it to my supervisor when I was teaching AP bio at the time and he looked at it, well that's kind of cool. How many do you want? I said, could I have like six? So he ordered eight from separate vendor.

Daylene Long (34:10):

So we

markniebojeski (34:10):

Were using those and I used those for years. And then when I stopped teaching AP bio, I gave it to the next teacher who's doing it and she's been using 'em now for a few years. So there's some things like that. But most of it is, most manipulatives that we have are just paper color cutout, move together. There's a nice origami that makes the helix for the DN that the students color put together and then they realize, oh look, it really does twist. That kind of thing.

Daylene Long (34:38):

Social media. Do you belong to Biology Teachers of America? Oh, of

markniebojeski (34:43):

Course. Yeah. All those, A bunch of them.

Daylene Long (34:46):

Do you have a favorite one? A kind of a go-to,

markniebojeski (34:49):

I know there's a national biology teachers group on Facebook. I'm still part of the one for AP Bio. I don't teach it anymore, but I'm still a part of their group. There's one for environmental science that I also check in on. There's one for the EMR that does. It's a national there, health Teachers association, health Sciences Teacher Association. I'm part of that. And you get a lot of good ideas and people freely share a lot of their material on there. A lot of good stuff on there. A lot of good collaboration. So I've enjoyed perusing those venues too.

Daylene Long (35:30):

Yeah, they are. And just the camaraderie and seeing what works and what doesn't work And

markniebojeski (35:35):

Someone posts up, I've been doing this for 20 years and I can't stand it anymore. What am I doing wrong? And then all these comments, it's same thing happening to me, same thing happening to me, don't worry about it. It's not you.

Daylene Long (35:42):

It's a national crisis, don't worry about it.

markniebojeski (35:45):

So it helps you not feel isolated.

Daylene Long (35:48):

Actually. Let's talk about that, the national crisis. What have you seen in your time teaching maybe particularly the last 10, 15 years, what's changed for you?

markniebojeski (36:01):

I've seen a lot of good people come into the career with great ideas, get little to no support from administrators and leave people. When I tell people I've been in the same place for 30 years, the looks I get are like, okay, do you have dirt on somebody that they can't fire? You kind. I'm a unique person. I do what I do. I love what I do. My students know I love them. I treat them like family, the whole, I've had some administrators who are brand new who I've never met say, oh, you're Mr. Zeki. I've heard so many good things about you from the port of Ed and downtown and these other people like, okay, I don't know you, who are you? But they know me already.

(36:41):

But I've seen a lot of young people come into the profession their first year teaching. I've mentored a few of them. They really have great ideas and whatnot, but then they get no support, real good concrete support from administrators and it kind of ruins the career for them. There was one teacher who left teaching altogether three years ago. He was actually a student of mine who went on to college, got his degree in chemistry, came back, be a chemistry teacher to show the students in the town that I came from here, here's what I did, you can do it too. He loved what he did, but the administrators just kept adding more and more stuff and pulling him this way and that way. And he just said, they've ruined teaching for me. And now he works for Mark. He doesn't even teach anymore.

(37:30):

It's a lot of the higher ups who every time we get a new administrator, they think they have the end all be all answer to save the world. And we just look at 'em like, we tried that 10 years ago, it didn't work then It probably won't work now, but we'll try it. And after a year or two it doesn't work, see told you. And I wish they would pay more attention to the people in the classroom. We know what works, we know what is a good thing, we know what we need as far as support from the administrators and too many just don't do that. They just have their own little agenda. They do what they want to do. And if you as a subordinate don't follow along, well then it's your problem, not mine. You're the problem kind of Thing. You're

Daylene Long (38:09):

Not the first one I've heard in this series that we're doing with that, doing so much more with less. And then in that situation. So I'm going to ask, do those administrators ever come into your classroom or what could vendors provide you to increase the knowledge of administrators or is?

markniebojeski (38:39):

I don't dunno if a vendor could really do much. I know it would be nice if every so often an administrator was required to come in and teach a class for a month, walk in our shoes kind of thing. I know where I am. A lot of the administrators are very bogged down with discipline issues and paperwork and family this and policy that and blah, blah blah. Where some of the kids don't even know who the vice principals are. They never see 'em. They're just hiding in their office. They're handling all these other little things. But then if something goes wrong in the classroom, the administrators are not aware of what's happening in the school. So they don't know what led up to it and what could have maybe prevented or headed off this possible conflict until it gets to the point where now it's a really big deal that shouldn't have been. Some of the best administrators I've had over the years are ones who made sure they walked to the hallways every day. They would stop in a classroom just, hi, how you doing? Can I get you anything? Say hello to the students, greet 'em in the hallways. The administrators who hid in their office and came out only when something bad happened and it was a different feel.

Daylene Long (39:57):

Yeah, I have to breathe on that one. Yeah. Okay. Well I want to be respectful of your time. So we really, here's my wrap up question then, and also if you have anything that you just want to say, but okay, so our client in this particular case and other clients that we work for, large vendors, our large companies, would you like to tell 'em, or if you had a wishlist or that's really two different questions, but what would you like to see you thought, man, that would be cool. And then also what would you like to, if that's not the same thing, what would you tell a vendor?

markniebojeski (40:47):

It would be nice if vendors would somehow maybe through just a questionnaire, a video, back and forth session or something, or come into a school, talk to the teachers, ask them what have you done in the past? What has worked? What have we given you that's worked, what hasn't? And try to tailor their product for what the classroom really needs. By that I mean there's some labs from other places and kits and materials you look at and go, okay, that looks nice, but it's not practical for my situation or part of this activity I could use with my students. But the rest of it not so much. So could you maybe break it up into you can buy the whole kit or just buy the component that you want to use?

(41:39):

I'm sure they do have teacher input in some way, shape or form when creating these things. I don't know how that works, but definitely ask teachers, what activity would you like to do for this topic and what would that look like? And maybe try to go with that as far as designing something new that would be better. Maybe try to differentiate things a little more for the socioeconomic background of places. Because where I teach, it's considering an inner city type of school district. It's got a high poverty rate. A lot of students on the free reduced launch program, reading levels are not where they should be. They're lower. So we get a kit that's meant for a junior biology class, but the students are not reading really well at that level. So I have to take time to break it down for them. Maybe have something that's a little easier to understand, easier to follow for those kind of students.

(42:45):

Even if it's the same kit, the same activity, but have two or three different student versions of how it's written up and presented to the student. Have one that's meant for a lower reader that maybe doesn't do all of the components, but does the key ones then have one that's maybe more for the honors student who can read at grade level, who can handle a little more and do the basic parts and then go with the next step with it. That might be a good thing to do. Oh, I just had an idea. Thank you.

Daylene Long (43:20):

Well this is how this kind of interview is, how the industry is saying, okay, how do we, let's sample what's going on out there and what

markniebojeski (43:31):

Happen

Daylene Long (43:31):

And what we want to have happen. So that sparked so many things, but at the same time is, yeah, so mean. Did anything pop in your head to say, you know what, this list lab kit was pretty close, but I'm not going to do it again because it's just too much work to make it what it should be, or something like that? Did anything that pop in your head on that one? Not

markniebojeski (43:56):

Really. I mean, most of the lab kits, even if they were of that caliber, I would take it upon myself to say, okay, part A and B worked. I'm not going to do part C

Daylene Long (44:05):

Or

markniebojeski (44:05):

Part B worked. But maybe using this material, using, I dunno if it's like a genetics, use kidney beans instead of peas because they're easier to see and hold, swap out.

Daylene Long (44:15):

That's

markniebojeski (44:15):

Something I just would take on myself and do as far as a specific, I can't think of anything at the moment, no.

Daylene Long (44:22):

Okay. Alright. Well then I'm going to give you your Friday evening back and then are you done with school now for the Holiday? No, we have one more week. Okay. Alright. And yeah, some are out today and yes. Okay. So the next step is tonight. I will send you an email thanking you sincerely for being a part of this. And also within that we'll have two questions. One, if you would be interested in being a part of something like this, again, we'd love to consider you on our friends list. And

markniebojeski (45:03):

I think this might be the second or third one I've done for this group. I believe. It seems very familiar to me. I've done

Daylene Long (45:10):

Okay. Okay.

markniebojeski (45:11):

I'll definitely do it again. Definitely. Yeah.

Daylene Long (45:13):

Okay. And then the other one is that I'll send you, it'll be my email and Daylene as well. If there's something that comes up tonight, tomorrow, then this next that you say, oh man, that's what I want to pass on, please do that as well. And then it'll probably be Monday and maybe tonight. Daylene. Iss the one who handles the gift cards. So it's a $95 gift card and it says Visa, but actually when you click on it, you can pick from many different Visa and Starbucks and Target, all that kind of thing. Okay. Okay.

markniebojeski (45:51):

Perfect.

Daylene Long (45:52):

Well thank you very much and thank you for what you're doing and continuing on. I

markniebojeski (45:57):

Still love it. I mean, the students I have this year, I've got 101 students over the classes I have, and every single one of 'em I would adopt if they needed to be even the knuckleheads, I would take them.

Daylene Long (46:12):

Those 101 are very, very lucky to have you.

markniebojeski (46:16):

Thank you.

Daylene Long (46:18):

Thank you. Okay, take good care.

markniebojeski (46:21):

You too. Bye bye.
