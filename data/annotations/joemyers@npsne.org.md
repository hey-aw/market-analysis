### Memorable Quote
- "I think we need to find ways to make it more authentic, which isn't easy and it's not cheap, but we're finding that if our kids are building models, even if they're just building a simple DNA model out of beads and pipe cleaners, they just don't have the tactile skills to build things." [30:43] (Discussing the importance of hands-on learning)

### Buyerâ€™s Journey
