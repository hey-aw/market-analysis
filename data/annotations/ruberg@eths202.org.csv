And in that way it's very structured for me.","Kimberly Herder (27:55): So on those catalogs, you said that the assistant keeps track of 'em. Do you ever get access to them and what do You do? I think I wanted

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (28:17): to, yeah, they're in our science office and I know they're there, but they're physical and they're big. And I don't want to, for lack of better words, if I was going to review a catalog, I would do it online. Because online has search functions, find functions, calculators. They're just easier for me. My tech savviness, I suppose when I get a physical catalog, even in my mailbox, I go, cool. And then I just bring it up to the department secretary going like, is this useful to you? That does restrict me in learning what's out there and what's new. I will admit that, but I just am not super physical male savvy or

Kimberly Herder (29:00): Interested,

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (29:00): I suppose.

Kimberly Herder (29:03): So if you're on, do you ever just go on a site and look on et acat? I mean, look what they have to offer. As you're mentioning it, I should peruse this new stuff that's out there more often, but I

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (29:14): Don't, and I also, you're just making me think about it. I also don't get advertisements or anything for them. I guess they're not targeted at me slash where would that even be? I don't think that my Facebook does technically know that I'm a science teacher, but I guess it doesn't show up on Facebook. But I feel like if it did, it would show up on Facebook. That's where most of my targeted ad seemed to show up. No, I genuinely, I guess if I was exposed to new stuff, it would be at a convention, like going to a biology NABT. I've only been to two of those just when they happen to be nearby or I happen to go to isef, the International Science and Engineering fair every year and every so often they have some cool research stuff, but not necessarily teacher focused, more research researcher, teacher focus as opposed to science teacher.

Kimberly Herder (30:24): Have any of those, do they give coupons or would any of that be motivating for you to look at something?

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (30:32): Yeah, the last time I went to NABT, there were a number of places that were really interesting. We went around, the people in my department, we kind of split up and went around little groups and we're like, check that out, go over there and see what that's about. And they give you little promos, especially since ultimately the person who ends up putting the stamp of approval on a purchase is my department chair. And then she's the one who puts the ultimate stamp of approval. This is sciencey claim evidence reasoning is what we teach our kids. So claim, evidence, reasoning. I myself have to come up with claim evidence reasoning. If I wanted to make a big purchase, which I haven't had to do really much for my biology class, but my zoology class, I am making some larger purchases for and for that I need to create a claim evidence reasoning. I need to say, I want this. Well, why do you want this? And so if the company's able to give me that argument already, that's very helpful.","['Customer Experience', 'Vendor Comparison']",Carolina,27:55

One of the reasons why I'm a little bit late is because I went to Dollar Tree to pick up some things because doing a lab experience ish tomorrow and I came up with the idea today, of course I will also order or I'll get a lot of stuff from Home Depot and Lowe's, honestly, because plants and stuff. But in terms of science equipment, largely Flynn, Carolina Biological Supply, and I really think those are the big two I and really maybe just some frivolous things from Amazon.

Some teachers are not that way apparently from what I've heard, but at least for me, my boss has always just been like, thank you, I suppose. And that's also with the book, we have a book that is technically a, it's not lab supply, it's a resource.

ruberg@eths202.org,"I start that process by asking the students. So I present the students with something interesting, or at least what I think is interesting, something that I hope is going to cause 'em to ask a lot of questions. And then it's designing stuff around those questions. Now, granted being a sneaky teacher, I know what their questions are going to be. So one of the phenomenon that I selected, for example, is cancer. So it's not a happy thing, but it evokes interest and that for the most part, I know what your average 14, 15-year-old is going to be asking about that disease and what they want to know. So once I get those questions, that's what I start with. Whenever I'm working off of designing or working with or deciding what I'm going to be using and purchasing in materials is to see if those are things that are going to directly lead to an experience to my students being able to answer those questions that they have as scientists.","Kimberly Herder (06:57): Okay, so you're doing experimental hands-on learning.

ruberg@eths202.org,"I feel like I have put my hands in everything at this point. So I'm part of, there's websites that I go to as of this year. I don't ignore chat GPT for a little bit of help for ideas and stuff. I'm part of social media groups. My school utilizes the Miller Libby Bubble Bee book to see if there's anything in there. I just look for everything for inspiration. But as I'm probably filled out in the survey, I ultimately will end up taking that stuff and making it my own regardless. It's just, I suppose the way that I'm structured as a type A person, but it's like, oh, but I really need to make this specific for me and my kids. I need to put my own voice into it and getting ideas and maybe data and then being where I got a credit from kind of thing, but trying to synthesize things together I suppose.","Kimberly Herder (11:37): So what are some of those, if you'd share some of those websites or social media, where do you go and why do you trust them or do you trust them? Well, you must, if you go to them,

Mr. Ruber-Strohm (11:50): I trust them as a starting point. I trust them as maybe like an idea bank. Honestly, the Facebook groups have some of the most influential things, which is really cool. It's just seeing what other people are doing. I trust them in the sense that it's other biology teachers, they're doing things. I'm not naive to the fact that there are biology teachers who teach very boringly and quite plainly, but I am still able to get inspired by those things and then utilize that to try to construct my own thing, I suppose.",['Digital Resources'],General,11:37
