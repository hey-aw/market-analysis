Well, a lot of things are based on phenomena, so the hands-on activities. It is kind of like twofold. We use, our district pretty much uses the five E lesson model, and so within that five engaged part, you're doing some type of phenomenon. So it could be something that the students can manipulate. It could be something that just really a phenomenon based type thing. And that is what really would be, is helpful to teachers to be able to have some type of something that would fit our standards that's phenomenon so that the students engages them. And then from that engagement, then you can teach your lesson, but at the same time, then later if you're doing a lab activity that's an application or a lab activity connect, then that would be the second type of hands-on type or something that students could manipulate. So it could actually be, I mean honestly and truly don't really like kits because to me it's just like the cookbook, but it has to be something that's more inquiry where the students are being able to be part of it, not like, okay, follow follow these steps.",['Product Quality'],[],20:03

No, it's been, I mean, since we have adopted the standards that we've had, and we've had these for many years, well, I didn't say many years, I guess since about 20, I can't even remember, but we've, this is not something new.

Well, some companies sell the kits and then they provide a coupon, I guess is what it would be, that you would just let them know, Hey, this, I want to get this. And then they send it to you because they generally, and then sometimes for plants, I just would go to a Home Depot and just buy them. There's some things that we do have some funding year to year that we can turn in to get reimbursed for certain things.

Okay. And with Carolina or Flynn, have you had any really great experiences or any that were not so great that you can share?

No. I mean, basically to me they're just about the same. Just companies that just provide, I haven't had any, I wouldn't say good or bad, they provide what they say and you just go with it. Sometimes they become a default. Many times when I say, when we need, all of a sudden we need to order, you kind of sometimes end up just going with them because you have their catalog and because you have to hurry up and order or because you know the name.
