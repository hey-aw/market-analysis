I feel very old right now that I had to think about that, but I was in public school for 27 years. I started my teaching career in a Catholic school for three years, so just helping me with my math if this is so, yeah, really it's like 30 and a half years. That's crazy.

That's very helpful because where our supplies come, they come to a different location and the person at the receptionist desk who has to take in that information, I mean the eco, I had to be refrigerated. The ampicillin had to be refrigerated, so it was nice to track it.","Janet Magargal (32:12):

I mean, I feel like all of them have been pretty positive. I bought, oh, I did buy, who is it? E coli. I bought e coli and ampicillin. Was that BioRad? I mean, everything has come very quickly.

The learning curve with City of Broth, anyway, there was a broth already in the lab, so instead of buying new, I just bought replacement.","Janet Magargal (33:00):

Did they provide instructions for making the broth or was that something you knew how to do from previous or,

That sounds good. I want to ask Kimberly to join us again. We've just got five minutes left, and I want to see if she's got any follow-up questions for us.

Janet Magargal (45:43):

Okay.

Kimberly Herder (45:45):

Hi, this has been fantastic. I'm interested or would like to know what you could say in a couple of minutes about the school or your experience. I mean, you had a few years in a different school. What would you say, knowing the questions that Daylene asked, how in a nutshell would you answer that for your former school

Janet Magargal (46:18):

In terms of,

Daylene Long (46:19):

It might be too broad, Kim, you might want to narrow that down, Kim.

Kimberly Herder (46:27):

Well, in ordering supplies or kits, or thinking about the student population there, what would you answer differently or how would you answer differently? Some of the questions that we've asked when you looked at ordering or funding or how you made those decisions, what you were going to use

Janet Magargal (46:49):

In the previous school, it would have to be bilingual. I taught 90% of students that could not speak English, so I would definitely need content differentiated. Even at the high school level, you would need things not only translated into a different language, but a huge need for scaffolded material, differentiated, adapted, just different forms of reading levels. So that would definitely be a huge difference. I mean, even in the current school, it would be nice to have options for differentiation. Some students do need things scaffolded a little differently, so that would be a huge time saver. I mean, I would be surprised if you would talk to an educator that doesn't have a diverse group of students, no matter where you are. I mean, they may physically look more similar in some settings than others, but there's always the academic need for structuring things differently, providing maybe a graphic organizer, sentence starters, and anything, I guess along those lines to aid in support. I mean, it's the whole concept of equity. What one student might need might look very different for another student to still share and have same concept.","['Digital Resources', 'Environmental Sustainability', 'Educational Policies']",[],46:49
