We've ordered from other places. Obviously","Neil McGovern (18:25): You're cutting out just a little bit. So I did, I'm sorry. That's okay. You said you primarily buy from wards, but you also buy from other suppliers. Yeah, so depending on the year we might buy from other suppliers as well and what they have at the time pretty much. Can you hear me? Daylene Long (18:42): Yeah, I can hear you. Neil McGovern (18:43): Okay. Yeah, I'm sorry. So like I said, we kind of search, so we ordered so early, we don't have catalogs yet from the company, so everything is through the online catalogs right now. So if there's something that we want to implement that we don't have awards, I'm going to go to one of the other sites, whether it's Fishers or Fisher or any of them and pretty much work for it. And when I find the one that I like, I'm usually able order it.","['Purchasing Experience', 'Vendor Comparison']","[""Ward's"", 'Fisher']",18:25
nmcgovern@pmsd.org,"I believe I ordered live invertebrate samples and so I think I ordered mealworms through Carolina because no Paria I they Carolina. So when I get the paria from Wards, they're all dead and inactive. When I get 'em from Carolina, they're in much better condition most of the time.","Daylene Long (28:43): Okay, that sounds good. And then lemme just flip through my notes just a little bit. Let's see, I'm just looking a little bit. How do you learn about new things you wanted to try? Let's talk about those skulls for a minute. Do you remember where you first learned about those? Neil McGovern (29:10): I honestly, the first time I saw those, I probably saw them in a catalog. So I'm a little bit of a self designer. I like to take activities and create little variations on 'em and redesign a little bit. I saw them in the catalog as part of a kit activity with supplies. And just in my head when I saw it, I knew exactly what I wanted to do with it. I knew I wanted to use an evolution. I knew I wanted to use it to create cladograms. And the procedure I like for Cladograms is I like to make kids take tape and put it on their table and actually position the living things at the end portions of the cladogram. And I knew I really wanted to start it with my honors biology classes and make them develop a procedure instead of using the procedure that comes with it, make them develop the procedure and the actual characteristics and measurements that they're going to use to determine that. And then from that point on with honors biology class, see how it went with them and then maybe move it in a form where they get a little bit, where they get more direction to be in some of the non-honor sections, they would need more direction on it where it's an honor. Daylene Long (30:24): Go ahead. So it wasn't something you were actually looking for. You're flipping through a catalog and you see it and the light goes on and that type of thing. Okay. Neil McGovern (30:34): Yeah, exactly. Daylene Long (30:35): And do you prefer the catalogs to the web or do you use both or? Neil McGovern (30:41): So I have to tell you, I love the paper catalog. Once again, the issue for us right now is we're doing our budget in October and we're not getting the new paper catalog until January, February, maybe something or maybe the end of the year. So it ends up being just on the web. For me, the problem with the web is everything's a search and it's so time consuming to do it that way and it's wards is probably the easiest, which is why, another reason I use them a lot, but it's just, it's time consuming. You type in the item you're looking for, you get 16 different choices, you have to click on that as well to see exactly which one is what you want. Whereas in the catalog, for example, with I know with Fisher and awards and catalogs, section glassware, these three pages beakers with a chart on it that says exactly this beaker made of this material in this measurement size, and for one, this is the cost next to it for a pack of 12, here's the cost. It's just really easy to use.","['Product Quality', 'Vendor Comparison']","['Carolina', ""Ward's""]",28:43
nmcgovern@pmsd.org,I'm a pretty level guy. I'm delighted if they get me the stuff on time and it works well.,"Daylene Long (35:13): Good. So let's see what else. Really our goal today is to find out a little bit more about what you buy for the life sciences, how that experiences for you, how you make your decisions, and the ultimate goal is really to help our client to understand where it is that they can offer you value. We know that teachers are doing more time or doing more with less, and so we want to make sure that we're kind of poking around the edges for ideas of what would make the materials either better for you or better for your students. So that's kind of our ultimate, you're going to see that we ask a lot of what and why questions, and we're just trying to get into the whole experience that you have and if there's any frustration points or if there's any areas where you've just been delighted. We want to know those things and it helps a lot of educators to think of Kim and i's filming a documentary that we're kind of going back to when you first decided that you needed something for your classroom all the way through the end. So those are my basics. Neil McGovern (36:36): Yeah. Daylene Long (36:37): Any question about those before I dive in? Neil McGovern (36:40): No, I think I'm ready. Daylene Long (36:42): Okay. So tell me a little bit about the last time that you needed to purchase materials for any of your life sciences or bio or environmental classes. Neil McGovern (36:55): That would depend whether you're talking about school budget or me personally buying things out of pocket that we do quite a bit right now. Daylene Long (37:03): Let's talk about school budget because yeah, we could talk forever about, Neil McGovern (37:10): I'm sure. Yeah, Daylene Long (37:11): Yeah. Neil McGovern (37:11): So school budget, our school, what we do is we do budget. We basically just did it every October for the next school year right now. So we're actually really early compared to what we used to be When we budget, we budget for the classes, the schedule that we currently teach and it's assumed that if your schedule teaching that right now that applies. So basically the way that we do it is there are some materials that get budgeted that go into a bid process, general classroom wise, colored pencils, markers, things like that, things that are science specific. I usually have the ability to order through non-bid sources using one of our biological suppliers, whether it's ward order a lot from right now, a lot of what we use in class, what's critical, more easy to find on their site, easy to order. We've ordered from other places. Obviously",['Customer Experience'],[],35:13
nmcgovern@pmsd.org,"For me with a vendor, it's very simple that the item I order is what I get and I get it on time.","Daylene Long (33:01): That makes sense. In the survey that you took, we had a lot of educators responded that reliability was really important to them in terms of being trustworthy. Can you tell me a little bit about what it means to you that a vendor is reliable or trustworthy? Neil McGovern (33:26): For me with a vendor, it's very simple that the item I order is what I get and I get it on time.",['Customer Service'],[],33:26
nmcgovern@pmsd.org,"If there were companies that offered activities that had both, for example, a lab kit where there was both a physical hands-on version of it as well as a virtual version of it at the same time, that would delight me immediate immediately more than anything, it seems that there's a little bit of a disconnect right now between the actual physical hands-on products and the electronic products.","Daylene Long (36:10): Okay. So what I was imagining as you were talking, because you said sometimes it was hard to find them and you had to search, you had search that you would have by topic, like a hands-on kit for respiration along with a digital lab for respiration together. Neil McGovern (36:37): Once again, that's actually, it's great that you brought that up because that's what we're doing right now. So we're doing bioenergetics. So hands-on lab wise, we use right now what I use is I use the photosynthesis respiration activity that's in two parts and I like to vary activities a lot. I believe students need to be active, a very hands-on, very minds on type of teacher. Along with that, the resource that I use right now for interactive with photosynthesis, respirations actually excellent is the bio site that has games and virtual labs on it. So I dunno if you're familiar with that, but the bio site is, yeah, the bio site is excellent and his interactives, his little games is playing video games for the kids, his interactives with photosynthesis and respiration. There's no way you can't learn what it's taking in and letting out things like that just because win the game, you have to do that and the kids get so obsessed with winning the game, then you go back and you talk to 'em about, okay, so tell me, what did you have to do to get out of the mitochondrial matrix? Neil McGovern (37:05): Oh, we had to go through that pump, that a TP synthase pump when it turned and let us out. Okay. So what is that showing you in real life? What were you playing? Oh, I was this hydrogen ion and okay, so look at this. What did you just learn and oh, I see what I just did now I know I did that. So they worked together just really, really well. So many kids with so many different learning styles. You can't successfully be a teacher anymore that we had in high school where it was lecture all the time and things like that. That's not how things work anymore. It's got to be experienced, experienced hands-on experience where the experiences lead the lead into the learn lesson, not the other way around where the learn lesson is.",['Digital Resources'],[],36:37
