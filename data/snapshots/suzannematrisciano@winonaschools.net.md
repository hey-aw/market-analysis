### Insights

### Opportunities
- There is a need for more convenient lab kit purchasing options, specifically the ability to easily reorder consumables.
- Vendors could provide more support to new teachers who may not be aware of all their purchasing options or educational resources.
- Development of a secure online platform for tests and labs that prevents students from accessing other sites during use could be beneficial.
