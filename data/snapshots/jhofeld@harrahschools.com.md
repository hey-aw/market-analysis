### Insights
- Jennifer values hands-on, inquiry-based learning and prefers to teach biology in context rather than through memorization.
- She finds new teaching materials and ideas by attending conferences like NSTA and NABT, particularly drawn to booths with interactive labs and freebies.
- Funding is limited to a small annual grant and sometimes contributions from parents.

### Opportunities
- There is an opportunity for vendors to provide context-based lesson plans and materials that align with Jennifer's teaching approach.
- Vendors could benefit from offering professional development opportunities, especially interactive ones, that are accessible to teachers in less urban areas.
- Kits are seen as valuable, especially for new teachers or those teaching outside their content area, but they need to be cost-effective and relevant to the curriculum being taught.
