It sort of depends upon how the classes get divvied up and if there's something that somebody bought last year and they feel like, well this year I'm in pretty good stead that then they sort of let it go to somebody else. But then the other thing back to your previous question in terms of purchasing is that in terms of purchase orders and authorized vendors is that it's very set cut and dried if person's not on a vendor list. And this little publisher that did the additional supplemental materials for my AP was not on that list. So again, that sort of was the impetus for me to use my own money because I knew I wouldn't get money from some other source to do that. Yeah.\n",
